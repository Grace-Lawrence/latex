In contrast to cluster lensing measurements, cosmic shear is the correlation of
shears across the sky independent of the location of foreground structures.
Since the shear is related to mass, the cosmic shear can be used to directly
infer statistics of the underlying mass distribution, the evolution of which is
directly related to the properties of Dark Energy. Because the signal need not
be modeled in terms of cluster halos, the interpretation of cosmic shear can be
simpler than cluster lensing, but the measurement is more sensitive to
systematic effects.  Thus cosmic shear is quite complimentary to clusters.
Although this analysis will likely be led by others, the pipeline work of
Sheldon and the characterizations of systematic errors by Ma are crucial
to the success of this measurement.
