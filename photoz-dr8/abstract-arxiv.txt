We present redshift probability distributions for galaxies in the SDSS DR8
imaging data.  We used the nearest-neighbor weighting algorithm presented in
Lima et al. 2008 and Cunha et al. 2009  to derive the ensemble redshift
distribution N(z), and individual redshift probability distributions P(z) for
galaxies with r < 21.8.  As part of this technique, we calculated
weights for a set of training galaxies with known redshifts such that their
density distribution in five dimensional color-magnitude space was proportional
to that of the photometry-only sample, producing a nearly fair sample in that
space.  We then estimated the ensemble N(z) of the photometric sample by
constructing a weighted histogram of the training set redshifts.  We derived
P(z) s for individual objects using the same technique, but limiting to
training set objects from the local color-magnitude space around each
photometric object.  Using the P(z) for each galaxy, rather than an ensemble
N(z), can reduce the statistical error in measurements that depend on the
redshifts of individual galaxies. The spectroscopic training sample is
substantially larger than that used for the DR7 release, and the newly added
PRIMUS catalog is now the most important training set used in this analysis by
a wide margin.  We expect the primary source of error in the N(z)
reconstruction is sample variance: the training sets are drawn from relatively
small volumes of space.  Using simulations we estimated the uncertainty in N(z)
at a given redshift is $\sim$\localbias.  The uncertainty on calculations
incorporating N(z) or P(z) depends on how they are used; we discuss the case of
weak lensing measurements.  The P(z) catalog is publicly available from the
SDSS website.
