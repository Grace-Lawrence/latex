M01 is now M02 (ugh!)

section 4: paragraph 2: "To derive this parameter take a Jeans approach."
   needs a "we" in there.

section 5 paragraph 3: 
First sentence: "To test the our analysis...." remove "the" or "our"
Second sentence: probably should say "We define as isolated..."

section 6: I'm confused about the last paragraph. I'm not sure what
the first couple of sentences are saying and the second sentence
seems to make a claim, but doesn't refer to any graphs or numbers.
Also, I'm not sure about the z=0.2 thing, considering the weighting
is toward lower redshift, but the stongest signal is at z=0.15

The axis labels on figure 2 are really small
