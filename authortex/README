April 2002 -- updated authors and institutions

This package facilitates the construction of author lists for the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey.  The following files are included:

authortex.pl -- A PERL script that actually creates the author list
sdssauthors -- An ascii database file with all SDSS people (builders, 
	       participants, external collaborators, etc.) and their
	       institutions
sdssinstitutions -- An ascii database file listing all the
                    institutions and their addresses according to ApJ style 
		    (in the words of Greg Hajek):
			
  "The general formula breaks the affiliation into two parts:  that which
  is of interest to the post office, and that which is purely
  institutional.  Both should go from specific to general, so

   [department/division], [faculty/school], [local mail code],
     [institution], [suite], [post box/street address], [district],
     [city], [state/province], [country]

  The position of postal codes usually is in accord with the instructions
  of the Universal Postal Union (www.upu.int).  Either a post office box
  or a street address should be used, not both, and ZIP+4 should not be
  used if it obviously just restates the number of a post office box."

authortex.tar -- the above files in a single tar file


USAGE: ./authortex.pl authorlist [startindex 1] [sdssauthors] [sdssinstitutions]

OUTPUT: {authorlist}.tex

where "authorlist" is a file containing the desired author names in
the following format

quasar:authortex>more authorlist
FIRST TIER
Richards
Fan
Schneider
VandenBerk
Strauss
York

SECOND TIER
Gunn
Lupton
Pier
Rockosi
Uomoto
Yanny
Fukugita


First tier authors should be in the desired order.  Second tier
authors can be in any order, since the names are sorted.  The "FIRST
TIER" and "SECOND TIER" lines must appear exactly as shown.  The names
must match the names in the "sdssauthors" database file.

[startindex] is an optional argument that allows the author footnotes
to start at a number other than one.  For example if there is a
footnote to the title.

[sdssauthors] is the database file with author names and institutions.
Updates will be posted to

[sdssinstitutions] is the database file with addresses of the
institutions.  Updates will be posted to
