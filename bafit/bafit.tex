\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

intro

\section{Algorithm} \label{sec:algo}

The full algorithm is presented in \citet[][BA13]{ba13}.  There are a few basic
limitations and assumptions underlying this approach:

\begin{itemize}

    \item Only the mean shear over some region of sky is knowable.

    \item The posterior distribution of the shear from a large ensemble of
        galaxy shapes is Gaussian.

    \item The shear is small, $\gamma \ll 1$.

\end{itemize}

The first point follows from the fact that galaxies have intrinsic shapes, with
variance larger than the typical shear induced by structures in our universe.
This limitation would not apply if a large set of intrinsically round sources
were found.  Given this limitation, the estimation of shears from individual
sources is abandoned.

The second point follows from the first point and the central limit theorem: if
the shear is derived from a large enough ensemble of galaxy shapes, the
posterior necessarily approaches a Gaussian.

The third point is true under most circumstances, but will for example break
down along lines-of-sight near large clusters of galaxies.

Under these assumptions, a second-order estimator was derived for the shear,
consistent with the Gaussian assumption.  This form is a Taylor expansion of
the logarithm of the posterior for the shear.  The equations are given in full
in \citet{ba13}.

Prior information is key to this approach: the intrinsic distribution of
shapes, and how shapes respond to an applied shear.  The use of strong priors
on all parameters also suppresses noise-related effects, such as the shear
``noise bias''.  The basic statistics derived from each galaxy are integrals of
derivatives of the prior over the full likelihood; thus the full likelihood
must be explored.  The final shear statistic is itself an aggregate over these
derivatives.

An approach to measuring non-constant shear is also given, as are perturbations
to the second-order equations, but implementations of those ideas are left to
future work.

A full implementation, fitting to pixelized galaxy images, was not attempted by
\citet{ba13}.  The basic formalism was shown to work by generating shapes
$(g_1,g_2)$ from a distribution, adding noise and shear, and recovering the
underlying shear using the second-order formula.

\section{Implementation} \label{sec:impl}

For this work an implementation of the \citet{ba13} formalism was developed to
fit models to galaxy images, accounting for the point spread function and
pixelization.

Two types of models were fitted: An elliptical exponential disk model exp$(-r)$,
and an elliptical \devauc\ profile exp$( -r^{1/4} )$.

The estimator involves integrals over the full likelihood distribution for each
galaxy.  Exploration of the likelihood surface requires a large number of model
evaluations.  As an optimization, galaxy and PSF models were approximated as
sums of Gaussians according the to the fits in \citet{HoggGMix12}.  This use of
Gaussians for both galaxy and PSF models facilitates analytic convolutions of
the galaxy model with the PSF.  This is a faster and simpler alternative to
convolutions based on the generation of high resolution images that are
convolved using Fourier transform methods. While only approximate
representations, the Gaussian representations are sufficiently accurate to meet
our requirements.  We further optimize the code by using a fast exponential
function\footnote{https://github.com/herumi/fmath.  The code was translated
from C++ to C by the author.}.

 \caption{ Fractional error in the recovered shear for the estimator presented
     in \cite{ba13}.  The error is plotted as a
     function of galaxy signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), for various galaxy
     properties and two different measures of S/N.  In panel (a) is
     plotted \Tsn, where the measure of size is $T=I_{xx} + I_{yy}$.  In 
     panel (b) is plotted \fsn.  The flux and $T$ are parameters in the model
     fits, and the associated (S/N) is the ratio of best-fit value to error in
     the fit.  In each panel the fractional error is plotted for galaxies of
     different size and type, as described in the text.  As shown panel (a)
     panel, the error depends uniquely on \Tsn\ for different galaxy types and
     sizes.  However, \fsn\ is not a sufficient descriminator for different
     galaxy types and sizes.  The \Tsn\ can be used to remove galaxies from the
     sample that will yield poor shear estimates, independent of galaxy
     properties, but not so \fsn.  For \Tsn$~ > 10$ this shear estimator meets
 the accuracy requirements for the Dark Energy Survey, shown as the gray band.

     in a zero noise simulation.  The solid curve is the best-fit quadratic
     function of the true shear.  The quadratic error as a function of true
     shear indicates a break down of the second-order formulas presented in
 \cite{ba13}. The gray band represents the requirements for the Dark Energy
 Survey. \label{fig:nonoise}}
