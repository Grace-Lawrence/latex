\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

intro

\section{Algorithm} \label{sec:algo}

The full algorithm is presented in \citet[][BA13]{ba13}.  There are a few basic
assumptions underlying this approach.  Following the notation in BA13:

\begin{itemize}

    \item The shear is weak, $g \ll 1$.

    \item In the limit of weak shear, only the ensemble mean shear can be
        derived from galaxy shapes.

    \item The posterior distribution of the shear derived from a large ensemble
        of galaxy images is Gaussian.


\end{itemize}

The first assumption is true under most circumstances, but will break down
along lines-of-sight near large over-densities, such as clusters of galaxies.

The second assumption follows from the first, and the fact that galaxy images
are to be used to estimate the shear: galaxies have intrinsic shapes, with
variance larger than the typical shear induced by structures in our universe.
Given this limitation, the estimation of shears from individual sources is
abandoned.  This limitation would not apply if a large set of intrinsically
round, extended sources were found.

The third point follows from the central limit theorem: if the shear is derived
from a large enough ensemble of galaxy shapes, the posterior necessarily
approaches a Gaussian.

Under these assumptions, a second-order estimator was derived for the shear,
consistent with the assumption of a Gaussian posterior.  This form is a Taylor
expansion of the logarithm of the posterior for the shear, with shear as the
expansion variable:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:pexpand}
-\ln P(\vecg | \vecD) \approx {(\rm const)} - \ln P(\vecg) - \vecg \cdot \sum_i
    \frac{\vecQ_i}{P_i}
    + \frac{1}{2} \vecg \cdot \left[ \sum_i \left(\frac{\vecQ_i \vecQ^T_i}{P_i^2}
    - \frac{\matR_i}{P_i}\right) \right] \cdot \vecg,
\end{equation}
where the terms $P_i$, $\vecQ_i$, and $\matR_i$ are 
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:pqrdef}
P_i     & = & P(\vecD_i | \vecg=0) \nonumber \\
\vecQ_i & = & \left. \bnabg P(\vecD_i | \vecg)\right|_{\vecg=0} \\
\matR_i & = & \left. \bnabg \bnabg P(\vecD_i | \vecg)\right|_{\vecg=0}. \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

Prior information is key to this approach: these equations involve derivatives
of the un-lensed distribution of shapes, the prior $P$. To fully predict the
observed distribution of shapes, the un-lensed distribution of shapes must be
mathematically sheared and compared to observables.  Due to the approximations,
only derivatives near $g=0$ are required. The mean shear can be solved for and
is given by:
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:shdef}
\matC_g^{-1} & = & \sum_i \left(\frac{\vecQ_i \vecQ^T_i}{P_i^2} - \frac{\matR_i}{P_i}\right) \\
\bar{\vecg} & = &  \matC_g \sum_i \frac{\vecQ_i}{P_i}.
\end{eqnarray}

In practice the shape of each galaxy is not precisely known. The derivatives in
equation \ref{eq:pqrdef} are marginalized over the full likelihood distribution
for each galaxy, and these marginalized values are used in the aggregate shown
in equation \ref{eq:shdef}.  The use of strong priors on all parameters also
suppresses noise-related effects, such as the shear ``noise bias''.  

An approach to measuring non-constant shear is also given, as are third-order
tweaks to the second-order perturbations, but implementations of those ideas
are left to future work.

A full implementation, fitting to pixelized galaxy images, was not attempted in
\citet{ba13}.  The basic formalism was shown to work by generating shapes from
an analytic distribution, adding noise and shear, and recovering the underlying
shear using the second-order formula.

\section{Implementation} \label{sec:impl}

For this work a full implementation of the \citet{ba13} formalism was developed
to work with full pixelized noisy galaxy images, accounting for the point
spread function.

%Two types of models were fitted: An elliptical exponential disk model exp$(-r)$,
%and an elliptical \devauc\ profile exp$( -r^{1/4} )$.

The estimator involves integrals over the full likelihood distribution for each
galaxy.  Exploration of the likelihood surface requires a large number of model
evaluations.  As an optimization, galaxy models were approximated as sums of
Gaussians according the to the fits in \citet{HoggGMix12}.  The PSF was also
approximated using Gaussians.  This use of Gaussians for both galaxy and PSF
models facilitates analytic convolutions of the galaxy model with the PSF.
This is a faster and simpler alternative to convolutions using Fourier
transforms. While only approximate representations, the small associated error
in the shear recovery was not detectable in the simulations presented below.

A fast exponential function was used\footnote{https://github.com/herumi/fmath.
The code was translated from C++ to C by the author.} for rendering the galaxy
and PSF profiles.  Even so evaluation of the exponential function is the
bottleneck for this calculation.

A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) was used to explore the posterior surface.
Galaxies can have a wide variety of model parameters and errors in the best-fit
parameters.  It is not straightforward to predict what the parameter errors
will be before doing the full fit.  For this reason an affine invariant MCMC
method was used, as first presented in \citet{GoodmanWeare10}.  A new C code
was developed to for this, which is available on request. The python
implementation presented in \citet{Mackey13} was used during prototyping.  For
each galaxy, 20 ``walkers'' were used in the chain, with 400 burnin steps and
200 steps used for calculations.

\section{A Note on Parametrization}

Because Gaussians were used for modeling both Galaxies and PSF, it is
convenient to parameterize objects in terms of the second moments rather than
alternative quantities such as half-life radii.  This parametrization is also
intuitive: for real images it is the unweighted second moments that are
modified by convolution with the PSF of instrument and atmosphere; the
covariance matrices simply add. Another way to put this is that it is the area
that is modified by the isotropic part of the PSF, and it is the ratio of areas
that controls the influence of the PSF on the shape of a galaxy.  The quantity
$T = I_{xx} + I_{yy}$, was chosen as a convenient size parameter, where
$I_{ij}$ is the unweighted second moment $\langle x_i x_j \rangle$.

\section{Simulation} \label{sec:sim}

Pairs of galaxy images were generated at 90 degree offset in position
angle, to cancel shape noise.  This simulation strategy is known as
a ``ring test''\citep{Nakajima2007}.

Two types of models were generated, exponential disks and \devauc\ profiles.
Models were convolved with a simulated PSF, a single round Gaussian with
$\sigma = \sqrt{2}$ pixels $(T=4)$.  A simple PSF was chosen so that PSF
modeling was not an issue.  The models were also convolved with square pixels
of uniform response.

The un-lensed shape distribution was chosen to be identical to the toy
distribution used in \cite{ba13}.  This distribution is not a good description
of real galaxy shapes, but was chosen for consistency with that work.  That
distribution also has the required property that it is twice differentiable.

The other galaxy parameters were drawn from simple distributions.  The size
parameter $T=I_{xx} + I_{yy}$ was drawn from a log-normal distribution with
scatter of 15\%.  The total flux was drawn from a log-normal with 30\% scatter.
The centroid was drawn from a Gaussian in each coordinate, with $\sigma$ of 0.2
pixels.

Four suites of simulations were run:  Two runs with exponential disks and two
with \devauc\ profiles.  For each galaxy type, two different galaxy sizes were
chosen: $\sigma_{g}/\sigma_{\textrm{PSF}} = \{1.4,2.0\}$, which corresponds to
$T_{g}/T_{\textrm{PSF}} =\{2,4\}$.


\section{Fitting Simulated Galaxies} \label{sec:simfit}

The simulated images were fit using parametrized models as presented in \S
\ref{sec:impl}.   A Gaussian was fit to a rendered, pixelized PSF model, and
the full model was generated by analytically convolving the galaxy model with
this PSF model. By using a fit to the observed, pixelized PSF, the convolution
by the pixels is built in to the PSF model. Thus the analytic convolution of
PSF with galaxy fully models the true galaxy convolved with PSF and pixels.
While a single Gaussian does perfectly model a {\it pixelized} Gaussian PSF, in
practice the single Gaussian is sufficient for the resolution of these
simulations ($\sigma_{\textrm{PSF}}=\sqrt{2}$).  For a less well sample PSF, a
more complex model would be required.

Prior distributions were chosen to match exactly the true distributions used in
the simulation.  The correct model was fit in each case; i.e. when simulating
exponential disks, an exponential disk was fit.  By choosing the true priors
and model, the accuracy of the algorithm is tested without confusion with other
issues such as model bias or empirical prior determination.

\section{Results} \label{sec:results}

\subsection{Calibration Bias vs. \sn} \label{sec:snbias}

Figure \ref{fig:fracerr} contains results for each of the four simulation
suites discussed in \S \ref{sec:sim}, representing different galaxy types and
sizes. 

\begin{figure}[p] \centering
 \centering 
 \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{figures/cbafit-geg-T-s2n.eps}
 \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{figures/cbafit-geg-flux-s2n.eps}

 \caption{ Fractional bias in the recovered shear for the estimator presented
     in \cite{ba13}.  The bias is plotted as a
     function of galaxy signal-to-noise ratio $(S/N)$, for various galaxy
     properties and two different measures of $(S/N)$.  In panel (a) is
     plotted \Tsn, where the measure of size is $T=I_{xx} + I_{yy}$.  In 
     panel (b) is plotted \fsn.  The flux and $T$ are parameters in the model
     fits, and the associated $(S/N)$ is the ratio of best-fit value to error in
     the fit.  In each panel the fractional error is plotted for galaxies of
     different size and type, as described in the text.  As shown panel (a)
     panel, the bias depends uniquely on \Tsn\ for different galaxy types and
     sizes.  However, \fsn\ is not a sufficient descriminator for different
     galaxy types and sizes.  The \Tsn\ can be used to remove galaxies from the
     sample that will yield poor shear estimates, independent of galaxy
     properties, but not so \fsn.  For \Tsn$~ > 10$ this shear estimator meets
 the accuracy requirements for the Dark Energy Survey, shown as the gray band.
 \label{fig:fracerr}}

\end{figure}

The fractional bias is shown as a function of signal-to-noise ratio $(S/N)$,
for two definitions of $(S/N)$, \Tsn\ and \fsn.  The traditional measure of
signal-to-noise ratio is \fsn, defined as the best fit value of total
flux divided by the error in the fit.  A more useful definition of
signal-to-noise ratio is \Tsn, the signal-to-noise ratio of the galaxy {\it
pre-seeing} size.  As expected, fits to noisy galaxies will result in a noisy
determination of size, and also a noisy shear measurement. But small galaxies
are also more difficult to fit, even at higher values of flux signal-to-noise
ratio.  Thus it is intuitive that small galaxies may also yield poor shear
estimates.

The fractional bias in the recovered shear is, within errors, uniquely
determined by \Tsn.  But for \fsn, the fractional bias depends also on galaxy
type and size, indicating the \fsn\ is not a sufficient statistic for
determining the bias.

\subsection{Calibration Bias vs. True Shear} \label{sec:truebias}

\begin{figure}[t] \centering
 \centering 
 \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figures/fracerr-vs-shear.eps}

 \caption{Fractional bias in the recovered shear as a function of true shear,
     in a zero noise simulation.  The solid curve is the best-fit quadratic
     function of the true shear.  The quadratic bias as a function of true
     shear indicates a break down of the second-order approximation presented
     in \cite{ba13}. The gray band represents the requirements for the Dark
 Energy Survey. \label{fig:nonoise}}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Comparison to Dark Energy Survey Requirements} \label{sec:desreq}

Figure \ref{fig:fracerr} contains a gray band representing the requirements
for shear recovery in the Dark Energy Survey \citep[][DES]{DESWhitePaper}.  The
method meets DES survey requirements for \Tsn$ \gtrsim 10$.  Note no unique
value of the traditional flux signal-to-noise ratio \fsn\ is sufficient to
choose such galaxies.

Figure \ref{fig:nonoise} also contains a gray band representing DES
requirements.  For shears greater than about 0.05, the Taylor expansion
approximation is no longer sufficient to meet DES requirements.  An
implementation to higher order, or perhaps a different expansion, will be
required to accurately measure larger shears.
