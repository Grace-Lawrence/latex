\begin{itemize}


    \item Maintenance, power, cooling for DES computing provided free by BNL.
    (Brookhaven Computing Facility).

    \item Isolated cluster with dedicated job queue.   In production we cannot
    fight for resources.

    \item Tight integration with those who maintain the machines.

    \item Using special distributed disk model built on the Hadoop Distributed
    File System.  Provides the needed data throughput for image processing and
    high availability (can handle machine failure transparently due to
    redundancy).  Is scalable to petabyte installations; such installations
    exist.  We at BNL set this up and understand it, would have to transfer the
    knowledge to another site.  This would require significant time from
    Sheldon and experts at BNL.

    \item Technology developed in house: The processing framework for the
    lensing work was written by Sheldon.  This system would have to be
    transferred, requiring significant time from Sheldon.
