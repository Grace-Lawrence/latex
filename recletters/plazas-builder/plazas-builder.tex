\opening{Dear Committee,}

I am writing to nominate Andres Plazas for builder status.  Andres has spent
more than two years working on DES infrastructure tasks according to document
docdb: 5247. I have summarized his infrastructure work in following table.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
    \hline
    Dates              & Location & Activity                         & Time (FTE-year) \\ \hline \hline
    Jun.-Oct. 2006     & FNAL     & CCD Testing \& Characterization  & 0.375 \\
    Jun.-Aug. 2007     & FNAL     & CCD Testing \& Characterization  & 0.25  \\
    Jun.-Aug. 2008     & FNAL     & CCD Testing \& Characterization  & 0.25  \\
    \hline
    2009-2011          & UPenn    & Weak Lensing Pipeline Testing    & 1.5 \\
    \hline
    2011-2012          & UPenn    & Astrometry \& Photemetry Testing & 0.4 \\
    2012-2014          & BNL      & Astrometry \& Photemetry Testing & 1.0 \\
    \hline
    Sep. 2013          & CTIO     & DES Observer \& Run Manager      & 0.4 \\
    \hline 
    Sep. 2013          & BNL      & Eyeball Squad                    & ? \\
    \hline 
    Fall 2013          & BNL      & Exposure Checker                 & ? \\
    \hline
    \hline
    Total              &          &                                  & 4.175 \\
    \hline
\end{tabular}

Andres' work on CCD testing was performed at FNAL under the supervision of J.
Estrada, T. Diehl, B. Flaugher, D. Kubik, H. Cease., T. Shaw , G.  Bernstein,
B. Jain (Penn), and J. P. Negret (Universidad de los Andes, Bogot ÃÅ).  His work
involved the measurement and validation of crosstalk, full-well level,
non-linearity, persistence (validation of the ERASE mechanism), diffusion, and
charge transfer inefficiency.

Andres' work at U. Pennsylvania was supervised by Gary Bernstein.  This work
involved testing of the ``shaplets'' pipeline developed by Jarvis and Sheldon.
In particular Andres tested the recovery of the point spread function (PSF) and
shear estimation in the presence of various systematic effects.  He also began
his work measuring astrometric residuals while at UPenn.

Andres' work at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) is supervised by Erin
Sheldon.  Andres' characterized the astrometric and photometric residuals in
the DES science verification data, in particular the ``tree-rings'' and
``glowing edges''. He has has successfully modeled the tree-ring effect
assuming they are caused by lateral electric fields associated with non-uniform
doping during the manufacturing
process.\cite{PlazasProceedings2014,Plazas2014}.  The astrometric templates he
has derived will be used to refine the astrometric solution in DES images.


\closing{Sincerely, }
