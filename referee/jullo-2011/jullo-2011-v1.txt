Overall Comments

    This is an interesting topic, worthy of study with the current sample in
    extension of earlier works.

    Parts of the text are very poorly written, for example the introduction.
    Other parts are much better, perhaps due to different authors.  Even
    without regard to the results, the paper does not, as a whole, meet the
    standards for writing that I would expect of a journal publication.  I'm
    not going to detail the writing problems as that is not my responsibility.
    I will instead say that a significant reworking of the entire text should
    be undertaken to bring all parts of the document to an acceptable quality.

Abstract

    You claim *exhaustive* in redshift, stellar mass, and scale but this is
    obviously not the case.  You are only 80% complete in stellar mass, you are
    using a magnitude limited sample of galaxies, you are using a limited and
    not precisely understood redshift range, and of course you are working on
    very limited and mixes physical scales.  This is precisely not exhaustive.

Introduction

    weight function in equation 1, you say sigma_i s the width of the ellipticity
    distribution but you mean the error distribution.

2.3 

    This section mixes up the idea of catalog selection and photoz methodology.
    These should be separated for clarity.


    For your "redshift bins" it seems you are essentially demanding that
    objects hava zmin < z < zmax with some probability, and the you sum the
    p(z) of those objects.  What you actually have is p(z|m) where m are the
    independent variables (magnitudes).  So what you essentially demand is:

        integral(p(z|m), zmin, zmax) > p0. 

    (not exactly since your p(z) are not gaussian and you are using "sigma")
    This seems to be a reasonable approach; I restate it here in order to
    clarify my question below about the foreground galaxy sample.



    You say it is the redshift distribution of the foreground material, but
    this isn't exactly correct. It is the effective weight.  The *effective*
    redshift distribution of the material would be the actual redshift
    distribution multiplied by this weight in redshift space.  Your statement
    is only accurate if the distribution of material is uniform in redshift
    space.

    How did you choose the objects in the foreground lens sample?  You say you
    "obtain" them and then give exact ranges, whereas you only have probability
    distributions; did you do straight redshift cuts or do you apply the
    probabilistic cuts as for the source bins? 

    "redshift of the lensing efficiency" has no meaning, it is a function.
    What are you trying to say?  Are you talking about bias in the photozs?

    paragraph 5: what S/N cut is I814 < 26.5?  If that is the completeness
    limit, why are you choosing foreground objects at the completeness limit?
    I could understand choosing source ("background") galaxies near the limit
    but not foreground.

    You refer to bundy et al as "he", should say "they" or something indicating
    plurality, as it is bunday *et al.*

    "The second order derivatives are the convergence" you mean the sum of
    phixx and phiyy is kappa, etc.  Please be careful and accurate with your
    language for the sake of those readers who are not experts. If you are
    going to talk about it, you should probably just give the equations.
    Otherwise eq 4 and 5 are sufficient.

3.1

    "almost work in Fourier space" is not a meaningful statement.  There is a
    lot of information *behind* your statement, such as independence of modes
    in Fourier space for certain kinds of measurements under certain
    conditions.  Better to just say exactly what you mean.

3.2

    The text of this section if very poorly written.  Please rework this
    section carefully.

    Please explain in the main text how the f1 and f2 are measured, and how
    this measurement is different from the similar terms in equations 15 and
    16.  The only details I found were in figure 2.

4.

    Your error bars seem to be monotonically increasing with scale.  This
    means you need state explicitly in the text and figures at what
    scale you measure b.  For example in figure 13.
