To Whom It May Concern-

I am writing to give my full support of Dr. Zhaomin Ma's application for permanent
residency in the United States of America.

Dr. Ma joined me as a Postdoctoral Researcher at Brookhaven National Laboratory
in the Fall of 2009.  Since that time we worked on a new astronomical
instrument to study the phenomena of Dark Matter and Dark Energy in our
universe.  These phenomena are perhaps the greatest mysteries of our time, and
Dr. Ma has dedicated his life to investigating the influence they have on the
universe around us.

I have a PhD in astrophysics from the University of Michigan, and am currently
an associate physicist at Brookhaven National Laboratory.  I have worked my
entire career on various experiments designed to illuminate the Dark Matter and
Dark Energy mysteries.  Dr. Ma and I are currently working on the Dark Energy
Survey,
