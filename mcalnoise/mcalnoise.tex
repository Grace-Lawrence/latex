\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

\section{Metacalibration} \label{sec:algo}

Suppose we have a biased shear estimator $E$.  We can expand this estimator
in a Taylor series around the true shear
\begin{align}
    E(\gamma) &= E(\gamma=0) + \gamma ~ \frac{ \partial E }{ \partial \gamma }\bigg|_{\gamma=0}  + ... \nonumber \\
      & \approx  \gamma ~ \frac{ \partial E }{ \partial \gamma } \bigg|_{\gamma=0}  \\
      & \equiv  \gamma ~ \mbox{\mcalR} \nonumber
\end{align}
where $\gamma$ is denotes the true gravitational shear.  We call \mcalR\
the shear response.

The essence of \mcal\ \citep{HuffMcal} is to estimate the shear response
\mcalR\ for a shear estimator $E$ directly from image data.  This is
accomplished using a numerical derivative.  The original image $I$ is
de-convolved from the point spread function (PSF), sheared, and re-convolved
with a slightly larger PSF.  This \mcal\ process is repeated for a
positive and negative shear, which can be used to form a central derivative.
We can represent this as a series of operations on the observed image $I$:
\begin{equation}
    I(\gamma) = I \Asterisk P^{-1} \oplus \gamma \Asterisk P_{d}
\end{equation}
where $\Asterisk$ represents convolution, $\oplus$ represents shearing,
and $P$ represents the point spread function.  De-convolution
is represented as ``inverse'', $P^{-1}$.  The slightly larger PSF, or
dilated PSF, is represented by $P_{d}$.

To form the central derivative we shear by a small positive and negative
amount $\gamma$
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Rnum}
    R = \frac{E(+\gamma) - E(-\gamma)}{2 \gamma}.
\end{equation}
The shear estimator can also be derived from the re-convolved
images
\begin{equation} \label{eq:estimator}
    E = \frac{E(+\gamma) + E(-\gamma)}{2}.
\end{equation}

For a constant shear, the response and shear estimators can be averaged
separately and combined to recover the mean shear:
\begin{equation}
    \gamma = \frac{ \langle E \rangle }{\langle \mbox{\mcalR} \rangle}.
\end{equation}
In \cite{HuffMcal} a more sophisticated inference was used, in order to deal
with the relatively large variance in \mcalR\ associated with the particular
estimator used therein.

Another correction can be derived for errors in the correction for 
PSF anisotropy.  This correction involves shearing the PSF rather
than the galaxy:
\begin{equation}
    \mbox{\mcalRpsf} = \frac{E(+\gamma^{p}) - E(-\gamma^{p})}{2 \gamma^{p}},
\end{equation}
where $\gamma^{p}$ is a shear applied to the PSF.  This
term adds to the estimator $E$, multiplied by the PSF shape
\begin{equation}
    E = \mbox{\mcalR} \gamma + \mbox{\mcalRpsf} e^{p} 
\end{equation}
This term can be subtracted to approximately correct for additive PSF errors:
\begin{equation}
    \gamma = \frac{ \langle E \rangle - \langle \mbox{\mcalRpsf} e^{p} \rangle }{\langle \mbox{\mcalR} \rangle}.
\end{equation}
In practice we calculate mean responses, factoring out the response term:
\begin{equation}
    \gamma = \frac{ \langle E \rangle - 
            \langle \mbox{\mcalRpsf}\rangle \langle e^{p} \rangle }{\langle \mbox{\mcalR} \rangle}.
\end{equation}


\section{Contamination of the Response by Correlated Noise} \label{sec:contam}

In the presence of noise, the observed image can be written $I_o=I+\eta$, where $\eta$
is the ``noise image''.  The \mcal\ sheared images $I_o(\gamma)$ will contain
contributions from de-convolved, sheared and re-convolved noise:
\begin{align}
    I_{o}(\gamma) &= (I + \eta) \Asterisk P^{-1} \oplus \gamma \Asterisk P_{d} \nonumber \\
    &= I(\gamma) + \eta(\gamma).
\end{align}
The de-convolution correlates the noise
across the image.  This correlated noise is sheared, and then re-convolved by
the dilated PSF, producing the sheared correlated noise image $\eta(\gamma)$.

We expect the sheared correlated noise to partly cancel in the estimator in
equation \ref{eq:estimator}, because the effect is averaged over both positive
and negative shears. This quantity is further averaged over many galaxies.

However, the sheared correlated noise term will not cancel when calculating the
response, which is the difference of positive and negative shears.  This
remainder is amplified due to division by $2 \gamma$ to form the central
derivative.  We thus expect the observed response \mcalRo\ to be contaminated
by the response of the correlated, sheared noise \mcalRnoise\
\begin{equation}
    \mbox{\mcalRo}  =  R + \mbox{\mcalRnoise}
\end{equation}

A correction is also required for the PSF response term \mcalRpsf.  We find
this correction is similar in magnitude to the correction for \mcalR, although
it is somewhat suppressed in the final estimator due to multiplication by $e^p$.

\subsection{Expected Scaling of the Bias with Noise Level} \label{sec:scaling}

The bias in the ellipticity due to correlated noise should scale
with the noise correlation function, and thus the square of the noise level in
the image $n^2$ \citep{HirataCorrNoise}.  As stated above, this same bias will
propagate into the response.  We can write the observed \mcalRo\ as a contribution
from both the actual response \mcalR\ and a noise term \mcalRnoise\
\begin{align} \label{eq:scaling}
    \mbox{\mcalRo} &= R + \mbox{\mcalRnoise}  \nonumber \\
                   &= R + A n^2.
\end{align}

\section{Correction for Sheared, Correlated Noise} \label{sec:corr}

\begin{comment}
For shear estimators based on raw moments, without any form of iteration
or fitting, it would be sufficient to simply measure the moments of example
sheared correlated noise fields and subtract the mean response from the
responses measured on the real images.  Multiple realizations can be generated
for each galaxy to increase precision.
\end{comment}

The coefficient $A$ in Equation \ref{eq:scaling} can be calculated in simple
scenarios, as shown in \cite{HirataCorrNoise}.  However, the calculation is
more complex when modeling the effect of the PSF.  We instead explored three
different empirical corrections, described in the following sections.

\begin{comment}
There are advantages to forward modeling which we would like to retain: the
noise in \mcalR\ using our forward-modeling approach is an order of magnitude
smaller than that seen for the re-Gaussianization approach in \cite{HuffMcal}.
In particular we find that applying smooth priors on the model parameters,
which is natural in a forward-modeling approach, stabilizes the fit and results in
a large reduction in variance.  This reduction in noise facilitates the simple
inference method outlined in \S \ref{sec:algo}.  The failure rate is also
dramatically decreased when applying smooth priors:  we find a failure rate of
$\sim$0.003\%, as opposed to $\sim$6\% for the re-Gaussianization code
implemented in the GALSIM package \citep{GALSIM2015}.  For these reasons we
explore a simple empirical correction in the following section.
\end{comment}

%We outline some alternative methods in the appendix.

\subsection{Correction using GALSIM}

With guidance from the GALSIM developers, we attempted to use the GALSIM noise
isotropization and whitening functionality to correct the correlated noise.
Isotropization enforces four fold symmetry, introducing minimal extra noise,
while whitening completely whitens the image, introducing significant extra
noise.  However, neither of these methods improved the shear recovery in our
simulations.  It may be that some aspects of the \mcal\ procedure invalidate
the assumptions behind these correction methods.  In \S \ref{sec:fixnoise} we
explore a simpler approach to correcting the noise.

\subsection{Adding a Canceling Correlated Random Noise Field} \label{sec:fixnoise}

This method, which we refer to as ``\fixnoise'', is designed to statistically
cancel the effects of correlated noise caused by the \mcal\ procedure.  For each
image that was passed through the convolution and shearing steps, producing
an image $I(\gamma)_o$, we generated a random noise field
$\tilde{\eta}$, and applied the same operations but using a shear with
the opposite sign:
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{\eta}(-\gamma) = \tilde{\eta} \Asterisk P^{-1} \oplus (-\gamma) \Asterisk P_{d}.
\end{equation}
We then added this image to the $I(\gamma)_o$ image.
The result, $\tilde{I}(\gamma)$, is an approximation for the image
without correlated noise:
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{I}(\gamma) = I_o(\gamma) + \tilde{\eta}(-\gamma).
\end{equation}
We used these $\tilde{I}(\gamma)$ to measure the shapes and responses used in
shear recovery.  For a single image, this procedure will not exactly cancel the
correlated noise, because the original and added noise fields are not
identical; rather the effect should cancel when averaged over a large ensemble
of galaxies.

This procedure necessarily increases the noise in the shear recovery.  Thus,
both the response and estimator should be measured on the $\tilde{I}(\gamma)$
images, so that the response is representative of the correct noise level.  To
reduce the noise in the fits, multiple randomized noise fields could be
generated and fit, and the results averaged.  This would improve the precision,
at the cost of increased computation time.

\subsection{Detrending the Correlated Noise Bias} \label{sec:detrend}

We expect the bias in \mcalR\ due to correlated noise to scale with the square
of the noise in the image $n^2$ (see \S \ref{sec:scaling}).  We can add a small
amount of noise to the image such that $n \rightarrow n + \Delta n$.  If we
then run the new image through the \mcal\ process, we can measure
$R^{\mathrm{before}}$, a response that will include correlated noise effects.
We can write this observed response as
\begin{align}\label{eq:Rbefore}
    R_o^{\mathrm{before}} &= R + A (n + \Delta n)^2 \nonumber \\
       &\simeq R + A n^2 + 2 A n \Delta n
\end{align}
%&\simeq R + A n^2 + \frac{\partial (An^2)}{\partial n} \Delta n + ... \nonumber \\
where we have dropped terms of order $(\Delta n)^2$ and higher.  In equation
\ref{eq:Rbefore}, \mcalR\ is the response at noise $n+\Delta n$ in the absence
of correlated noise.  

We can also add identical noise {\em after} the original image  has been run
through \mcal, and measure $R^{\mathrm{after}}$.  The response when adding
noise after \mcal\ does not suffer any additional bias due to correlated noise:
\begin{align}
    R_o^{\mathrm{after}} &= R + A n^2.
\end{align}
The difference between these responses is then 
\begin{align}
    \Delta R &\equiv R_o^{\mathrm{before}} - R_o^{\mathrm{after}}  \nonumber \\
             &\simeq 2 A n \Delta n.
\end{align}

We propose the following procedure to correct for correlated noise:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Calculate $\Delta R$ for a series of noise offsets $\Delta n$.
    \item Average $\Delta R$ over all objects for each noise offset.
    \item Perform a linear fit to $\Delta R$ vs. $2 n \Delta n$ to find the 
        coefficient $A$.
    \item Apply a mean correction for correlated noise given by
        \begin{align}
            \mbox{\mcalRnoise} & \simeq A n^2.
        \end{align}
        with a similar correction for \mcalRpsf.
\end{enumerate}
If the noise varies between observations, we can apply a 
correction based on the mean variance $A
\langle n^2 \rangle$.


\section{Image Simulations} \label{sec:sims}

\subsection{Simulations with Parameteric Models}

We applied \mcal\ to a set of image simulations.  For the first set of
simulations we used parametric models, designed to be similar to that used in
\citet{bfd2015}.  We modeled galaxies as a bulge and disk, with offsets between the
bulge and disk components, such that the total image was not described by a
single ellipse.  Both components had the same ellipticity and half light radius
\hlr. The \hlr\ were drawn from a log-normal distribution centered at 2.0
pixels, with scatter of 0.5 pixels.  The bulges were offset in a random
direction from the disk center, with offsets drawn from a uniform distribution
between zero and \hlr.  The ellipticities were drawn from the simple model
presented in \cite{ba14}
\begin{align}
    P(e) &\propto \left[1-(e)^2\right]^2 \exp\left[-e^2/2\sigma^2\right],
\end{align}
with $\sigma=0.2$.

We convolved the galaxy images with a PSF modeled as a Moffat profile
\citep{Moffat1969}, with \hlr\ = 1.5 pixels.  We drew the PSF shapes from a
distribution designed to match that measured in the Dark Energy Survey
\citep[][(DES)]{DESSVShear}.  The DES PSF shape distribution is well fit by a
double Gaussian with width 0.18 in each dimension, but with different mean for
$e_1$ and $e_2$.  For the first set of sims, ``BD'', we set the mean to
$(0,0)$.  For the second set ``BDEllip'', we set the mean in $e_2$ to $0.007$,
matching that in DES, but leave the mean in $e_1$ zero as a control.

We designed the galaxy S/N distribution, shown in figure \ref{fig:s2n}, to
match the real DES galaxy catalog after a pre-selection of ``good galaxies''
\citep{DESSVShear}, but with no explicit S/N cut applied based on the model
fitting.  We adjusted the distribution slightly to give a distribution with
mode $\sim10$.  We sheared the galaxies with 1000 different randomly chosen values,
with amplitudes chosen uniformly in the range 0.01 to 0.08, and uniform random
orientations.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{s2n-bd16.eps}

    \caption{Distribution of S/N in the Bulge+Disk simulations. The
    left panel is a zoom-in around the mode.  The right panel is
the full distribution of $\log_{10}(S/N)$}

\label{fig:s2n}
\end{figure}


Ideally, the \mcalR\ measured for stars should be consistent with zero in the
mean, and thus not bias the ensemble shear estimate.  In order to test the
robustness of \mcal\ to stellar contamination, we included $\sim$\nsimNstarperc\ stars
in each simulation.  The stars were simply drawn as PSFs, with the same flux
distribution as used for the galaxies.  We refer to the simulations with
stars as ``BDStar''; the BD simulation is identical but with the stars
removed.

For the ``BDMask'' simulations, we masked parts of the data in order to mimic
certain effects in real images. Masking is important to test, because the
Fourier transforms used to perform the \mcal\ convolutions cannot accommodate
missing data.  In order simulate these effects realistically, we chose a sample
of real ``\uberseg'' masks used in Dark Energy Survey shear analysis
\citep{DESSVShear}.  These include masking of bad pixels, bad columns, and
masking for neighbors.  Pixels were masked for neighbors if they were closer to
the neighbor's SExtractor \citep{Bertin96} segmentation map than they were to
the central galaxy.  A random sample of $\sim 1200$ masks was selected to have
a masked fraction less than 30\%, to avoid extreme cases.  An example image and
mask are shown in figure \ref{fig:mask}.  Note our simulation did not include
actual neighbors, so we will only test our ability to deal with masked data,
not the efficacy of the masking strategy itself.

    \caption{Example DES image cutout and \uberseg\ mask.  The black wedge in
the lower right masks a nearby object, and the vertical black stripe masks a
bad column. }

\label{fig:mask}
\end{figure}


\subsection{COSMOS Simulations}

We designed a second set of simulations to mimic the ``real-galaxy'' simulations
used in GREAT3 challenge \citep{great3}, using galaxy images draw from COSMOS
data.  We implemented two important changes.  First, we oriented the galaxies
randomly rather than placing them in pairs to cancel shape bias.  Using random
orientations avoids cancellation of systematics such as some selection effects
\citep{DESSVShear}.  Second, we used optical aberrations in the PSF designed to
match that seen in the Dark Energy Survey data \footnote{Aaron Roodman, private
communication}.  Similar to GREAT3, we varied the aberrations were varied as
Gaussian around a fiducial value. These root-mean-squared variations, in units
of waves in the Noll convention are given in table \ref{tab:aberr}.  We used a
Kolmogorov model for the atmospheric component, with mean FWHM = 0.9 arscec.
For this configuration there are significant variations in the PSF ellipticity,
but relatively little net ellipticity across the entire
ensemble of realizations.
The code used to generate these simulations began as a fork of the GREAT3
public code base, and is freely available
online\footnote{https://github.com/esheldon/egret}.

\begin{table}
    \centering
    \caption{Root-mean-squared variation for the aberrations in the optical model,

        Trefoil in X & 0.06 \\
        Spherical & 0.03 \\

    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

In figure \ref{fig:cosmos} we show the distribution of measured \snr\ for the
COSMOS simulations.  The mode of the distribution is somewhat higher than that
of the parametric simulations, about 12 instead of 10.  Also shown is the
distribution of the half-light-radius \hlr, measured
from the \sersic\ model fits distributed with the COSMOS catalog as part
of the GREAT3 challenge.  The mean \hlr\ for these simulations
is about $1.8 \pm 0.8$, somewhat smaller than the
log-normal $2.0 \pm 0.5$ for the parametric simulations, but with a tail to larger
size.

        from a log-normal distribution with the specified mean and width, designed
        to roughly match the COSMOS galaxies.  The PSF ellipticity was

\section{Results} \label{sec:detrendsim}

We fit the images with a single Gaussian galaxy model and Gaussian PSF model
using the \ngmix\ code\footnote{https://github.com/esheldon/ngmix}.  All \mcal\
operations were performed using the \texttt{metacal} module from \ngmix.

Naively using these grossly incorrect models resulted in a large model bias,
and large uncorrected PSF anisotropy.  In addition there was significant {\em
ordinary} noise bias at the low S/N levels used in the simulations.  We used
the \mcal\ procedure, coupled with the above correlated noise fixes,
to derive corrections for these biases.

We used a maximum likelihood fit, with smooth priors on all parameters to
produce a stable fit; for most simulations we had not a single failure. The
failures occurred when using the \detrend\ method, which included no correction
for correlated noise during the fitting process itself, which seems to have
destabilized a small number of the fits.  Even so, the failure rates for the
\detrend\ method was about 0.003\%.  These priors were not tuned to the true
galaxy parameters.  For the flux and size we deliberately used priors that were
wider than truth by 20\%.  For the ellipticity we used $\sigma=0.3$ instead of
the true $\sigma=0.2$.

    simulation, with and without the ``\fixnoise'' corrections

    cancel the effects of correlated noise.  The extra noise
    broadens the distribution, but the correction results in a more symmetric
    distribution.  The top panels represent the multiplicative
    response \mcalR\ and the bottom panels represent the PSF response \mcalRpsf.}

\subsection{Measurements of the \detrend\ Parameters}

For the \detrend\ method, we measured $\Delta R$ vs $2 n \Delta n$ to find the
coefficient $A$.  In figure \ref{fig:detrend}, we show this fit for the RG
simulation.  The trend is well-fit by a linear model, as expected, with a slope
$A \simeq $\Aslope, implying a correction $A n^2 \simeq$ \Rcorr\ for this
simulation.

\subsection{Shear Recovery}


In table \ref{tab:results} we show for shear recovery in our simulations, with
and without applying correlated noise corrections.  Without correction, the
multiplicative bias $m$ is of order 0.1 for all simulations.  For simulations
with a net PSF anisotropy, we also found a significant remaining additive bias.

\begin{table*}
    \centering
    \caption{\Mcal\ results for each image simulation described in
        \S \ref{sec:sims} and table \ref{tab:sims}.  A single Gaussian was fit
    to both galaxy and PSF, resulting in significant multiplicative 
    bias $m$ and additive biases $c$ before applying the \mcal\ response
    terms. Results with and without correction
    for correlated noise are shown.  After applying corrections for
    correlated noise, the biases are all reduced to within accepable limits.
    Stellar contamination at the level of \nsimNstarperc\ increases
    the noise in the recovered shear by $\sim$5\% but does not introduce 
    a significant bias.  
    Our simple scheme to correct for masking is to
    replace the masked pixels with the value of the Gaussian model.  XXX Describe

\end{table*}

XXX describe both kinds of corrections

After applying correlated noise corrections, we found the multiplicative bias
to be consistent with zero within errors for the parameteric simulations. For
the real galaxy RG simulation we detect remaining multiplicative bias of
approximately \rgbias.  For the BDEllip parameteric simulations, which have a
net psf anisotropy, we still detected a small remaining additive bias, but it
was reduced by a factor of five in amplitied, as compared to results without
correlated noise corrections.

\subsection{Stellar Contamination} \label{sec:stars}

As indicated in table \ref{tab:sims}, for the ``Star'' type simulations, we
included an additional \nsimNStarTwo\ stellar objects, drawn simply as a PSF with
noise added.  The results are shown in table \ref{tab:results} for the ``Star''
type simulations.  We find that a stellar contamination of 
\nsimNstarperc\ does not introduce any significant bias, but does
increase the uncertainty by $\sim$5\%.

    left panel is a zoom-in around the mode.  The right panel is
the full distribution of $\log_{10}(S/N)$}

\end{figure}


\subsection{Masking Effects} \label{sec:masking}

In order to perform the Fourier transforms used for the \mcal\ convolutions, we
must replace any missing data due to masked pixel values.  In particular we
wish to avoid any artifacts in the transformed images that would mimic an
additional ``response'' to the applied \mcal\ shear.

As an baseline extreme case, we replaced the masked pixels simply with noise.
This resulted in few percent calibration biases.

A better alternative is to replace the missing data with the result of a model
fit.  We performed an initial maximum likelihood fit, before performing any
\mcal\ operations, and replaced the masked data with the value from the PSF
convolved model.  We used a Gaussian model for both PSF and Galaxy, which is a
poor representation of the data; we consider this a worst case scenario as a
model replacement. 

The results using the model replacement method are shown in table
\ref{tab:results} for the BDEllipMask simulation.  The measured bias did not
change significantly compared to the measurements on BDEllip, which is the
unmasked version of this simulation.


\subsection{Selection Effects} \label{sec:selection}

There are two main types of selection: detection effects and ordinary selection
effects.  Detection effects occur when placing a detection threshold, for
example a minimum S/N, which will preferably select galaxies with lower
ellipticity.  Ordinary selection on an initially unbiased detected sample can
induce additional bias via the same mechanism.

Determining detection effects requires prior information about the properties of
the galaxies in the sample, including those galaxies that do not exceed the detection
threshold.  Ordinary selection effects can in principle be determined without
prior information if the initial detections were unbiased, but unbiased
detection of faint galaxies is unlikely to be feasible.

To test selection effects, we make a series of cuts on S/N in the BD
simulation.  We use the ``round'' S/N definition in order to avoid the first
order effect \citep{DESSVShear}. As indicated in table \ref{tab:selresults},
these cuts lead to a monotonic change in the recovered shear, with a few
tenths of a percent bias for a $S/N > 20$ cut.

\begin{table*}
    \centering
    \caption{\Mcal\ results when applying selections on the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) to the BD simulations. Selections
    were applied to an initially unbiased sample; i.e. no {\em detection}
    bias was present in the sample. \label{tab:selresults}}
    \begin{tabular}{ |l| r|r|r|  r|r|r|}
        \hline
        & \multicolumn{3}{c}{Uncorrected for Selection} & \multicolumn{3}{c}{Corrected for Selection} \\
        Selection & $m \times 10{^3} $ & $c_1 \times 10^4$ & $c_2 \times 10^4$ & $m \times 10^{3}$ & $c_1 \times 10^4$ & $c_2 \times 10^4$ \\
        \hline
        %$(S/N) > 5$    & $3.0 \pm 4.4$ & $-0.3 \pm 0.2$ & $0.2 \pm 0.2$ & $3.3 \pm 4.4$ & $-0.3 \pm 0.2$ & $0.2 \pm 0.2$  \\

        $(S/N) > 10$   & $-1.5 \pm 0.5$ & $-0.3 \pm 0.2$ & $0.2 \pm 0.2$ & $-1.0 \pm 0.5$ & $-0.3 \pm 0.2$ & $0.2 \pm 0.2$  \\
        $(S/N) > 15$   & $-2.3 \pm 0.5$ & $0.0 \pm 0.3$ & $0.0 \pm 0.3$ & $-0.9 \pm 0.5$ & $0.0 \pm 0.3$ & $0.0 \pm 0.3$  \\
        $(S/N) > 20$   & $-2.7 \pm 0.6$ & $-0.3 \pm 0.3$ & $-0.2\pm 0.3$ & $-0.9 \pm 0.6$ & $-0.3 \pm 0.3$ & $-0.2 \pm 0.3$  \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{table*}

We implemented a simple correction based on our \mcal\ measurements.  We
sheared the population of ellipticities with a fake shear using the measured
responses \mcalR, and estimated the shear using our \mcal\ mechanism before and
after selection.  We then used the ratio of these numbers as a correction
factor.  We sow the results in table \ref{tab:selresults} in the ``Corrected
for Selection'' column.  This simple correction reduced the bias approximately
$10^{-3}$ in all cases.

In real data, a simple correction scheme like the above will probably require
prior information.  One approach would be to take deep imaging data and add
noise such that the distribution of $S/N$ for the galaxy sample is similar to a
shallower data set.  The noisy ellipticity measurements could then be sheared
artificially and selected as above to derive a correction.  Multiple noise
realizations could be used to increase the precision of the correction.


\subsection{Using a Random Subset To Calculate \Detrend\ Corrections}

Measuring the \detrend\ parameters requires extra computations, at least a
factor of three to fit the linear parameters given in \S \ref{sec:detrend}, and
a factor of four if an additional point is used to check for possible
non-linearity. These extra computations could be expensive for large surveys.  

However, the \detrend\ parameters are more precisely measured than the shear
itself.  Here we explore the precision of the recovered shear using smaller
subsets of the object catalog to measure the \detrend\ parameters, and
applying the corrections to the full sample.  In Table \ref{tab:subsets}
we show the shear recovery parameters for various subset sizes, for the
BD simulation described in \S \ref{sec:detrendsim}

\begin{table*}
    \centering
    \caption{Additional variance in the recovered shear 
        using different sized subsets to
        estimate the detrending corrections.  Values were obtained
        from 100 bootstrap samples. \label{tab:subsets}}
    \begin{tabular}{| c | c |}
        Subset Size & Extra Error \\
        \hline
        1\% & 4.4\% \\
        5\% & 0.8\% \\
        10\% & 0.3\% \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{table*}
%        1\% & 30\% \\
%        5\% & 13\% \\
%        10\% & 8\% \\


We find that a relatively small sample can be used to determine the correlated
noise correction.  Calculating the detrending terms for 10\% of the sample
leads to only 0.3\% extra variance in the recovered shear, and using 1\% of
galaxies leads to only 4.4\% increase in variance.

To calculate these numbers we have assumed the extra uncertainty is added
quadratically with the uncertainty measured using all galaxies to estimate the
\detrend\ parameters; e.g for the first row, we have added approximately 30\%
quadratically with the measured uncertainty, resulting in a net increase of
4.4\%.

It is important to use a truly random subset of the population to determine the
corrections, including a fair sample of stars and other contaminants, and a
representative amount of pixel level masking.  If a particular aggregate shear
measurement involves a selection, this selection must also be applied to the
random subset.

\section{Bias on GREAT3 Simulations}

Relatively little bias was seen by \cite{HuffMcal} using the GREAT3
simulations \citep{great3}.  We checked that our code used to perform
the metacal procedures for the \cite{HuffMcal} work and ours give identical
results\footnote{Eric Huff, private communication}, so this is most likely not
a software error.  Rather, we suspect that the higher S/N and better modeling
used in \cite{HuffMcal} resulted in reduced bias.

The correlated noise effect scales with the square of the noise, and the
simulations used for GREAT3 contain significantly higher S/N than the
simulations used in this work.  Indeed, we found the correlated noise was still
detectable in simulations we ran with similar properties to GREAT3, but with
correlated noise bias at the 1-2\% level rather than the 12\% we saw in our RG
simulations.  We also ran the re-gaussianization code on our simulations, and
did see a bias, but about a factor of two lower than we saw for our
intentionally bad Gaussian PSF and Galaxy models.

Another important difference between the GREAT3 sims and our sims is that
GREAT3 galaxies were generated in a ``ring configuration''.  The simulation
included two identical images of each galaxy, rotated by 90 degrees with
respect to a one another, in order to cancel shape noise.  However, we ran one
of our simulations in a ring configuration and saw the same level of correlated
noise bias.  This is not surprising; the correlated noise effect adds coherently
to the response, and should not cancel due to such imposed symmetries in the
underlying galaxy population.

\section{Additional Correction Methods}

\subsubsection{Simulating Models}

In this method, we generated model images with the correct noise level corresponding
to each real imag.  We then measured the response of the noise due to the
convolutions and shears used in \mcal, with noise added before and
after the \mcal\ procedure.

The measurement with correlated noise will be the sum of the response
without correlated noise plus the response of the correlated noise field
\begin{equation}
    \mbox{\mcalRnoisemodel} = \mbox{\mcalRmodel} + \mbox{\mcalRnoise}
\end{equation}
This measurement is quite noisy for a single galaxy, but we
can estimate the mean correlated noise response for an ensemble
of galaxies
\begin{equation}
    \langle \mbox{\mcalRnoise} \rangle = \langle \mbox{\mcalRnoisemodel} \rangle - \langle \mbox{\mcalRmodel} \rangle.
\end{equation}
Each entry used in this average corresponds to the best fit model
and noise properties for a galaxy in the sample.

The response \mcalRnoise\ can be subtracted to recover an estimate of the mean
response without correlated noise
\begin{equation}
    \langle \mbox{\mcalR} \rangle = \langle \mbox{\mcalRo} \rangle - \langle \mbox{\mcalRnoise} \rangle.
\end{equation}
These responses will be noisier than the original images, due to the
independent noise in both \mcalRo\ and \mcalRnoise.  To increase
precision, the procedure can be repeated for different noise fields
and averaged, at the cost of increased computation time.
