\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

\section{Metacalibration} \label{sec:algo}

Suppose we have a biased shear estimator $E$.  We can expand this estimator
in a Taylor series around the true shear
\begin{align}
    E(\gamma) &= E(\gamma=0) + \gamma ~ \frac{ \partial E }{ \partial \gamma }\bigg|_{\gamma=0}  + ... \nonumber \\
      & \approx  \gamma ~ \frac{ \partial E }{ \partial \gamma } \bigg|_{\gamma=0}  \\
      & \equiv  \gamma ~ \mbox{\mcalR} \nonumber
\end{align}
where $\gamma$ is denotes the true gravitational shear.  We call \mcalR\
the shear response.

The essence of \mcal\ \citep{HuffMcal} is to estimate the shear response
\mcalR\ for a shear estimator $E$ directly from image data.  This is
accomplished using a numerical derivative.  The original image $I$ is
de-convolved from the point spread function (PSF), sheared, and re-convolved
with a slightly larger PSF.  This \mcal\ process is repeated for a
positive and negative shear, which can be used to form a central derivative.
We can represent this as a series of operations on the observed image $I$:
\begin{equation}
    I(\gamma) = I \Asterisk P^{-1} \oplus \gamma \Asterisk P_{d}
\end{equation}
where $\Asterisk$ represents convolution, $\oplus$ represents shearing,
and $P$ represents the point spread function.  De-convolution
is represented as ``inverse``, $P^{-1}$.  The slightly larger PSF, or
dilated PSF, is represented by $P_{d}$.

To form the central derivative we shear by a small positive and negative
amount $\gamma$
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Rnum}
    R = \frac{E(+\gamma) - E(-\gamma)}{2 \gamma}.
\end{equation}
The shear estimator can also be derived from the re-convolved
images
\begin{equation} \label{eq:estimator}
    E = \frac{E(+\gamma) + E(-\gamma)}{2}.
\end{equation}

For a constant shear, the response and shear estimators can be averaged
separately and combined to recover the mean shear:
\begin{equation}
    \gamma = \frac{ \langle E \rangle }{\langle \mbox{\mcalR} \rangle}.
\end{equation}
In \cite{HuffMcal} a more sophisticated inference was used, in order to deal
with the relatively large variance in \mcalR\ associated with the particular
estimator used therein.

Another correction can be derived for errors in the correction for 
PSF anisotropy.  This correction involves shearing the PSF rather
than the galaxy:
\begin{equation}
    \mbox{\mcalRpsf} = \frac{E(+\gamma^{p}) - E(-\gamma^{p})}{2 \gamma^{p}},
\end{equation}
where $\gamma^{p}$ is a shear applied to the PSF.  This
term adds to the estimator $E$, multiplied by the PSF shape
\begin{equation}
    E = \mbox{\mcalR} \gamma + \mbox{\mcalRpsf} e^{p} 
\end{equation}
This term can be subtracted to approximately correct for additive PSF errors:
\begin{equation}
    \gamma = \frac{ \langle E \rangle - \langle \mbox{\mcalRpsf} e^{p} \rangle }{\langle \mbox{\mcalR} \rangle}.
\end{equation}
In practice we calculate mean responses, factoring out the response term:
\begin{equation}
    \gamma = \frac{ \langle E \rangle - 
            \langle \mbox{\mcalRpsf}\rangle \langle e^{p} \rangle }{\langle \mbox{\mcalR} \rangle}.
\end{equation}


\section{Contamination of the Response by Correlated Noise} \label{sec:contam}

In the presence of noise, the observed image can be written $I_o=I+\eta$, where $\eta$
is the ``noise image``.  The \mcal\ sheared images $I_o(\gamma)$ will contain
contributions from de-convolved, sheared and re-convolved noise:
\begin{align}
    I_{o}(\gamma) &= (I + \eta) \Asterisk P^{-1} \oplus \gamma \Asterisk P_{d} \nonumber \\
    &= I(\gamma) + \eta(\gamma).
\end{align}
The de-convolution correlates the noise
across the image.  This correlated noise is sheared, and then re-convolved by
the dilated PSF, producing the sheared correlated noise image $\eta(\gamma)$.

We expect the sheared correlated noise to partly cancel in the estimator in
equation \ref{eq:estimator}, because the effect is averaged over both positive
and negative shears. This quantity is further averaged over many galaxies.

However, the sheared correlated noise term will not cancel when calculating the
response, which is the difference of positive and negative shears.  This
remainder is amplified due to division by $2 \gamma$ to form the central
derivative.  We thus expect the observed response \mcalRo\ to be contaminated
by the response of the correlated, sheared noise \mcalRnoise\
\begin{equation}
    \mbox{\mcalRo}  =  R + \mbox{\mcalRnoise}
\end{equation}

A correction is also required for the PSF response term \mcalRpsf.  We find
this correction is similar in magnitude to the correction for \mcalR, although
it is somewhat suppressed in the final estimator due to multiplication by $e^p$.

\subsection{Expected Scaling of the Bias with Noise Level} \label{sec:scaling}

The bias in \mcalR\ due to correlated noise should scale with the 
noise correlation function, and thus the square of the noise level
in the image $n^2$ \citep{HirataCorrNoise}.  The observed \mcalRo\
is thus given by
\begin{align} \label{eq:scaling}
    \mbox{\mcalRo} &= R + \mbox{\mcalRnoise}  \nonumber \\
                   &= R + A n^2.
\end{align}

\section{Correction for Sheared, Correlated Noise} \label{sec:corr}

\begin{comment}
For shear estimators based on raw moments, without any form of iteration
or fitting, it would be sufficient to simply measure the moments of example
sheared correlated noise fields and subtract the mean response from the
responses measured on the real images.  Multiple realizations can be generated
for each galaxy to increase precision.
\end{comment}

The coefficient $A$ in Equation \ref{eq:scaling} can be calculated in simple
scenarios, as shown in \cite{HirataCorrNoise}.  However, the calculation is
more complex when forward-modeling the PSF, as we do in this work.

There are advantages to forward modeling which we would like to retain: the
noise in \mcalR\ using our forward-modeling approach is an order of magnitude
smaller than that seen for the re-gaussianization approach in \cite{HuffMcal}.
In particular we find that applying smooth priors on the model parameters
stabilizes the fit and results in a large reduction in variance.  This
reduction in noise facilitates the simple inference method outlined in \S
\ref{sec:algo}.  The failure rate is also dramatically decreased when applying
smooth priors:  we find a failure rate of $\sim$0.002\%, as opposed to
$\sim$6\% for the re-gaussianization implemented in the GALSIM package
\citep{GALSIM2015}.  For these reasons we explore a simple empirical correction
in the following section.  We outline some alternative methods in the appendix.

\subsection{Detrending the Correlated Noise Bias} \label{sec:detrend}

As mentioned in \S \ref{sec:scaling}, we expect the bias in \mcalR\ due to
correlated noise to scale with the square of the noise in the image $n^2$.  We
can add a small amount of noise to the image such that $n \rightarrow n +
\Delta n$. We then run the new image through the \mcal\ process, and measure
$R^{\mathrm{before}}$.
The response when adding noise before \mcal\ is given by
\begin{align}\label{eq:Rbefore}
    R_o^{\mathrm{before}} &= R + A (n + \Delta n)^2 \nonumber \\
       &\simeq R + A n^2 + 2 A n \Delta n
\end{align}
%&\simeq R + A n^2 + \frac{\partial (An^2)}{\partial n} \Delta n + ... \nonumber \\
where we have dropped terms of order $(\Delta n)^2$ and higher.  In equation
\ref{eq:Rbefore}, \mcalR\ is the response at noise $n+\Delta n$ in the absence
of correlated noise.  

We can also add identical noise {\em after} the original image  has been run
through \mcal, and measure $R^{\mathrm{after}}$.  The response when adding
noise after \mcal\ does not suffer any additional bias due to correlated noise:
\begin{align}
    R_o^{\mathrm{after}} &= R + A n^2.
\end{align}
The difference between these responses is then 
\begin{align}
    \Delta R &\equiv R_o^{\mathrm{before}} - R_o^{\mathrm{after}}  \nonumber \\
             &\simeq 2 A n \Delta n.
\end{align}

We propose the following procedure to correct for correlated noise:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Calculate $\Delta R$ for a series of noise offsets $\Delta n$.
    \item Average $\Delta R$ over all objects.
    \item Perform a linear fit to $\Delta R$ vs. $2 n \Delta n$ to find the 
        coefficient $A$.
    \item Apply a mean correction for correlated noise given by
        \begin{align}
            \mbox{\mcalRnoise} & \simeq A n^2.
        \end{align}
        with a similar correction for \mcalRpsf.
\end{enumerate}
If the noise varies between observations, we can apply a 
correction based on the mean variance $A
\langle n^2 \rangle$.


\section{Image Simulations}

We apply the de-trending correction scheme to a set of image simulations.  The
first simulations make use of parametric models, and are designed to be similar
to that used in \citet{bfd2015}.  The galaxies models were bulge+disk.  Both
components had the same ellipticity and half light radius \hlr. The \hlr\ were
drawn from a log-normal distribution centered at 2.0 pixels, with scatter of
0.5 pixels.  The bulges were offset in a random direction from the disk center, with
offsets drawn from a uniform distribution between zero and \hlr.  The
ellipticities were drawn from the simple model presented in \cite{ba14}
\begin{align}
    P(e) &\propto \left[1-(e)^2\right]^2 \exp\left[-e^2/2\sigma^2\right],
\end{align}
with $\sigma=0.2$.  The PSF was an elliptical Moffat profile (XXX ref), with
\hlr\ = 1.5 pixels. The PSF ellipticity was drawn from a double Gaussian with
width 0.018, designed to match that the PSF shape distribution measured
in the Dark Energy Survey
\citep{DESSVShear}. The mean in $e_2$ was set to 0.007, also matching DES, but
the mean in $e_1$ was set to 0.0 as a baseline reference.  The S/N distribution,
show in figure \ref{fig:s2n},
was also designed to match real DES data, with $S/N \gtrsim 10$.  Galaxies
were sheared with 300 different randomly chosen shears, with amplitude chosen
uniformly in the range 0.01 to 0.08, with uniform random orientations.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{run-bd21mcal-dt01-s2n-hist.eps}

    \caption{Distribution of S/N in the Bulge+Disk simulations. The
    left panel is a zoom-in around the mode.  The right panel is
the full distribution of $\log_{10}(S/N)$}

\label{fig:s2n}
\end{figure}



We included ``stars'' in the simulations.  This is a useful test of the
robustness of \mcal\ to stellar contamination, since stars should have \mcalR\
consistent with zero, and thus not bias the shear estimate.  The stars were
simply drawn as PSFs, with the same flux distribution as used for the galaxies.

We also masked parts of the data in order to mimic certain effects in real
images. Masking is important to test, because the Fourier transforms
used to perform the \mcal\ convolutions cannot accomidate missing data.  In
order simulate these effects realistically, we chose real ``\uberseg'' masks
used in Dark Energy Survey shear analysis \citep{DESSVShear}.  These include
masking of bad pixels, bad columns, and masking for neighbors.  Pixels were
masked for neighbors if they were closer to the neighbor's SExtractor
\citep{Bertin96} segmentation map than they were to the central galaxy.  An
example image and mask are shown in figure \ref{fig:mask}.  Note our simulation
did not include actual neighbors, so we will only test our ability to deal with
masked data, not the efficacy of the masking strategy itself.

\section{Results} \label{sec:detrendsim}

The images were fit with a single Gaussian galaxy model and Gaussian PSF model.
Naively using these simple galaxy and PSF model results in a large model bias,
and large uncorrected PSF anisotropy.

A maximum likelihood fit was used, with smooth priors on all parameters to
produce a stable fit.  These priors were not tuned to the true galaxy
parameters; priors on flux and size were deliberately wider than truth by 20\%,
and that on ellipticity used $\sigma=0.3$ instead of the true $0.2$.  We
furthermore expect large {\em ordinary} noise bias at these low S/N levels.


The measurement of $\Delta R$ vs $2 n \Delta n$ is shown in figure
\ref{fig:detrend}.  The trend is well-fit by a linear model, as expected, with
a slope $A \simeq $\Aslope, implying a correction $A n^2 \simeq$ \Rcorr\ for this
simulation.

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{run-bd13mcal-dt02-Rnoise-detrend-R11.eps}

    \caption{Trend of $\Delta R_{1,1}$ with $2 n \Delta n$, where $n$ is the
    original noise level and $\Delta n$ is the additional noise added.  The
trend is linear  as predicted.}

\label{fig:detrend}
\end{figure}

Applying these corrections to $R$, we recover the shear within the
measurement error. These basic results are shown for the ``BD'' simulation
in table \ref{tab:results}

\begin{table*}
    \centering
    \caption{\Mcal\ results for each image simulation. \label{tab:results}}
    \begin{tabular}{ | c | c | c | c | c | c | c | c | c | c | c | c |}
        Sim & $m_1 \times 10^4$ & $m_2 \times 10^4 $ & $c_1 \times 10^5$ & $c_2 \times 10^5$ \\
        \hline
        BD          & $6.1 \pm 6.1$ & $3.1 \pm 6.4$ & $-3.1 \pm 2.1$ & $-2.2 \pm 2.1$   \\
        BDStar      & $6.1 \pm 6.5$ & $3.4 \pm 6.7$ & $-2.4 \pm 2.3$ & $ 2.4 \pm 2.2$   \\
        BDStarMask  & $6.1 \pm 6.1$ & $3.1 \pm 6.4$ & $-3.1 \pm 2.1$ & $-2.2 \pm 2.1$   \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{table*}

Without correction, the multiplicative bias $m$ is $\simeq$ 0.1
for these simulations.

\subsection{Stellar Contamination} \label{sec:stars}

As indicated in table \ref{tab:sims}, for the ``Star'' type simulations, we
included an additional \nsimNstar\ stellar objects, drawn simply as a PSF with
noise added.  The results are shown in table \ref{tab:results} for the ``Star''
type simulations.  We find that a stellar contamination of 
\nsimNstarperc\ does not introduce any significant bias, but does
increase the uncertainty by $\sim$5\%.

\subsection{Masking Effects} \label{sec:masking}

The Fourier transforms used for the \mcal\ convolutions cannot accommodate
missing data.  We must replace the masked pixel values with good proxies.  In
particular we wish to avoid any artifacts in the transformed images that would
mimic an additional ``response'' to the applied \mcal\ shear.

As an baseline extreme case, we replaced the masked pixels simply with noise.
This resulted in few percent calibration biases.

A better alternative is to replace the missing data with our best model.  We
performed an initial maximum likelihood fit, before performing any \mcal\
operations, and replaced the masked data with the value from the PSF convolved
model.  We are using a Gaussian model for both PSF and Galaxy, which is far
from the ``best model''; we consider this a worst case scenario as a model
replacement. 

The results using the model replacement method are shown in table
\ref{tab:results} for the Mask type simulations.  XXX discuss results when they
are available.


\subsection{Selection Effects} \label{sec:selection}

\subsection{Using a Random Subset To Calculate Detrending Corrections}

The detrending parameters are precisely measured relative to the shear itself.
Here we explore the precision of the recovered shear using subsets of
the objects to measure detrending.  In Table \ref{tab:subsets} we 
have shown the
shear recovery parameters for various subset sizes, for the same simulation
described in \S \ref{sec:detrendsim}

\begin{table*}
    \centering
    \caption{Additional variance in the recovered shear using the
        detrending method, using different sized subsets to
        estimate the correctios.  Values are obtained
        from 100 bootstrap samples. \label{tab:subsets}}
    \begin{tabular}{| c | c |}
        Subset Size & Extra Error \\
        \hline
        1\% & 4.4\% \\
        5\% & 0.8\% \\
        10\% & 0.3\% \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{table*}
%        1\% & 30\% \\
%        5\% & 13\% \\
%        10\% & 8\% \\


To calculate these numbers we have assumed the extra uncertainty is added
quadratically with the measured uncertainty; e.g for the first row, we have
added approximately 30\% quadratically with the measured uncertainty, resulting
in a net increase of 4.4\%.

It is important to use a truly random subset of the population, including a
fair sample of stars contaminate the sample, and a representative level of
pixel level masking.  If a particular aggregate shear measurement involves a
selection, this selection must also be applied to the random subset.

\section{Cancellation in Ring Configurations}

This bias was not seen by \cite{HuffMcal} using the GREAT3 simulations
\citep{great3}.

The only substantial difference between the GREAT3 sims and our sims is that
GREAT3 galaxies were generated in a ``ring configuration''.  The simulation
included two identical images of each galaxy, rotated by 90 degrees with
respect to a one another, in order to cancel shape noise.  In this configuration,
the correlated noise also appears to cancel at some level.

\appendix

\section{Additional Correction Methods}

\subsubsection{Adding a Sheared, Correlated Random Noise Field}

In this method, we generate example random noise fields $\tilde{\eta}$, sheared
with the opposite sign of those used in the \mcal\ procedure:
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{\eta}(-\gamma) = \tilde{\eta} \Asterisk P^{-1} \oplus (-\gamma) \Asterisk P_{d}.
\end{equation}
This noise image can then be added to the $I(\gamma)_o$ images to
statistically remove the effects of sheared, correlated noise:
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{I}(\gamma) = I_o(\gamma) + \tilde{\eta}(-\gamma),
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{I}(\gamma)$ is an approximation for the desired image
$I(\gamma)$.    These $\tilde{I}(\gamma)$
can be used to measure the correct \mcal\ for a large population.
It is important that the random noise field be added after
the \mcal\ procedures have been applied, not before.

This procedure increases the noise by a factor of $\sqrt 2$.  Thus, both the
response and estimator should be measured on the $\tilde{I}(\gamma)$ images, so
that the response is representative of the correct noise level.  To reduce the
noise in the fits, multiple random fields can be generated and added to the
original image, and these can all then be fit simultaneously.  This will
improve the precision of the fit, at the cost of increased computation time.


\subsubsection{Simulating Models}

In this method, we generate model images with the right noise level for a
given galaxy, and then measure the response of the noise due to the
convolutions and shears used in \mcal.  We then subtract the mean sheared noise
response from the mean measured response, averaged over some set of galaxy
images. The process is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]

    \item Measure the response without correlated noise
    
        \begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
            \item Render the best fit model, including convolution by the point-spread
                function

            \item Perform the \mcal\ image processing steps, without noise added.

            \item Add an appropriate amount of noise to all images, using the
                same noise pattern $I_\eta$ for every image.

            \item Measure the response for this model \mcalRmodel.
        \end{enumerate}

    \item Measure the response with correlated noise
    
        \begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
            \item Render the best fit model, including convolution by the point-spread
                function

            \item Add an appropriate noise pattern $I_\eta$ to the image, the
                same pattern used for measuring the response without correlated
                noise.

            \item Perform the \mcal\ image processing steps on this noisy
                image.

            \item Measure the response for this model \mcalRnoisemodel.

        \end{enumerate}

    \item Subtract the correlated noise response

\end{enumerate}

The measurement with correlated noise will be the sum of the response
without correlated noise plus the response of the correlated noise field
\begin{equation}
    \mbox{\mcalRnoisemodel} = \mbox{\mcalRmodel} + \mbox{\mcalRnoise}
\end{equation}
This measurement is quite noisy for a single galaxy, but we
can estimate the mean correlated noise response for an ensemble
of galaxies
\begin{equation}
    \langle \mbox{\mcalRnoise} \rangle = \langle \mbox{\mcalRnoisemodel} \rangle - \langle \mbox{\mcalRmodel} \rangle.
\end{equation}
Each entry used in this average corresponds to the best fit model
and noise properties for a galaxy in the sample.

The response \mcalRnoise\ can be subtracted to recover an estimate of the mean
response without correlated noise
\begin{equation}
    \langle \mbox{\mcalR} \rangle = \langle \mbox{\mcalRo} \rangle - \langle \mbox{\mcalRnoise} \rangle.
\end{equation}
These responses will be noisier than the original images, due to the
independent noise in both \mcalRo\ and \mcalRnoise.  To increase
precision, the procedure can be repeated for different noise fields
and averaged, at the cost of increased computation time.
