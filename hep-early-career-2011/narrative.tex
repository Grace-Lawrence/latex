I propose to analyze data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) to constrain the
properties of Dark Energy.  My primary focus will be on measuring gravitational
lensing effects to probe the expansion history and growth rate of massive
structures in our universe.  I am a DES ``builder'' with data rights and a
leader of the DES lensing effort.

Dark Energy accelerates the expansion of the universe, dramatically increasing
the volume in comparison to a matter-only universe.  Dark Energy also inhibits
the growth of massive structures under gravitational collapse.  Thus the number
density of massive objects such as galaxy clusters as a function of cosmic time
is directly related to the properties of Dark Energy, in particular the
equation of state parameter $w=$pressure/density.  Critical to using the number
density to constrain cosmology is knowing the masses of the clusters. We will
measure these masses using gravitational lensing.  Using cluster counts,
lensing and other complimentary probes, the DES will measure $w$ to $\sim$3\%.
This program is a natural continuation of my earlier measurements of lensing in
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), which are most sensitive such measurements
to date, and naturally leads to future work on projects such as the Large Scale
Synoptic Telescope\cite{lsstweb}.

DES will enter commissioning in \commissdate.  In collaboration with Mike
Jarvis of UPenn and Zhaoming Ma of BNL, I will spend the intervening time
tuning the data reduction pipelines, which we strenuously test using realistic
simulations.  

After first light, DES will take data for five years, during which I will
process the data as it arrives and perform analysis to extract Dark Energy
parameters.  These analyses will most likely produce results in three stages:
an early set of results from the first year data, a second set of results after
two or three years when multi-epoch data are available, and a final set of
results from the full data set in 2016.  The DES survey will produce of order a
petabyte of data which will arrive in a steady stream.  For this work I will
require significant computing infrastructure and the assistance of a
research associate.

\setcounter{section}{1}
\subsection{Introduction}

%The phenomenon of Dark Energy is one of the unsolved mysteries of our time.
The initial discovery of Dark Energy was made by studying the expansion history
of our universe.  According to General Relativity, a universe containing only
ordinary matter decelerates at late times under its own gravitation, but recent
studies of the brightnesses of distant supernovae indicate that our universe
has begun to accelerate \cite{Riess98,Perlmutter99}.  This can happen if there
is an exotic energy component in our universe with an equation of state
parameter $w$=pressure/density that is less than -1/3.

The observational consequences of a Dark Energy component in our universe are
numerous, but for our purposes the following are most relevant: 1) The
expansion history follows a form quite different from that of a matter only
universe, with a change in the sign of the acceleration at late times from
negative to positive \cite{Carroll92}.  2)  Unlike in a matter-only universe,
the growth history of massive structures through gravitation is no longer
determined solely by the properties of the mass density field and the value of
the present day expansion rate \cite{Haiman01}.  For example, without Dark
Energy, the number density of gravitationally collapsed structures of a given
mass at a given time in history is predictable essentially from the Hubble
expansion constant $H_0$ and low order statistics of the mass field such as the
mean of the density and the variance in the density as a function of scale
(ignoring baryons).  But in the presence of Dark Energy, the volume changes
over time in a dramatically different way and the growth of structures is
inhibited.  The cumulative effects of Dark Energy significantly alter the
predicted number of massive structures in a given volume of space.

Gravitational lensing is particularly well suited to studying this problem
(e.g. \cite{Kaiser98,Hu04}).  Lensing is the apparent bending of light as it
passes massive structures.  The amount of bending depends on the lens mass and
the geometry of the lens-source-observer system.  Thus, measurements of a large
sample of lenses at various cosmological epochs will elucidate the expansion
history of the universe, encoded in the geometry, and the growth history,
encoded in the statistical distribution of the measured masses.  

Lensing is more appropriate for measuring masses in an cosmological context
than other techniques.  The traditional technique of using orbital calculations
and Kepler's laws to infer masses does not work because the timescales are too
long to characterize the orbits. Velocities can only be used in a statistical
way, and require assumptions about the dynamical equilibrium of the systems in
question, which is often dubious on the physical scales of interest.
Furthermore, interpretation based on luminous tracers is complicated by the
ubiquitous presence of another mysterious substance: Dark Matter.  Dark Matter
dominates the mass density field, but because it is collisionless it is
distributed very differently from the luminous matter.  Often there are no
luminous tracers in the relevant regions of space with which to infer masses.
With lensing, one only needs enough background sources with which to
statistically measure the lensing signal.

I propose to use data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES, \cite{DESWhitePaper})
to perform gravitational lensing measurements and infer the properties of Dark
Energy.  I am a DES ``builder'', having worked steadily on the project since
it's inception.  Among other things, this designation brings perpetual data
rights for myself, a postdoc and students.  I am a leader in the DES lensing
effort.  My focus will be primarily on optimal measurement of the gravitational
shear induced in the shapes of galaxies by lensing, and using the shear to
infer statistics of the mass density field, namely the mass associated with
galaxy clusters and the power spectrum of the mass density fluctuations in our
universe. Both of these measurements will be highly sensitive to the properties
of Dark Energy.  Using a combination of techniques, we expect to constrain the
equation of state parameter $w$ to a few percent.  As I will describe below,
this is a natural extension of my earlier work in Gravitational Lensing using
data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and will lead naturally to work
on the Large Scale Synoptic Telescope \cite{lsstweb}, in which I am a
participant 

\subsection{Previous Lensing Measurements in the SDSS} \label{sec:sdssold}

Using data from the SDSS \cite{York00}, I have made highly accurate and precise
measurements of gravitational shear. I have used these measurements to estimate
the total mass content (normal and dark) associated with galaxies and clusters
of galaxies
\cite{fis00,Sheldon04,SheldonLensing07,JohnstonLensing07,SheldonM2L07}.  These
high quality measurements are facilitated by the excellent data and processing
software of the SDSS, and our development of interpretational techniques that
can extract masses from complex statistical shear measurements
\cite{JohnstonInvert07}.

In these works we measured the shear from millions of background source
galaxies at various projected distances from foreground lenses, from which we
inferred the radial mass density profile.  Because the signal is very weak, we
additionally averaged the signal over many lenses.  This averaging, while in
principle diluting information about the individual lenses, has the positive
effect of averaging out line of sight projections and ``lumpiness'' in the
lenses, which complicates the interpretation.  This in turn facilitates the
extraction of accurate masses.  Figure \ref{fig:massngals} shows results
from \cite{SheldonLensing07,JohnstonLensing07}. Plotted is mean cluster mass as
a function of the number of galaxies in the cluster.

is critical to measuring Dark Energy with galaxy clusters.\label{fig:massngals}}
\end{figure}

\caption{Constraints on the fractional mass density of our universe $\Omega_m$
and the relative variance in the density on 8 Mpc scales $\sigma_8$ as measured
from SDSS data.  These results \cite{RozoCosmo09} are derived by combining the
counts of galaxy clusters with the mass calibrations from gravitational lensing
as shown in Figure \ref{fig:massngals}
\cite{SheldonLensing07,JohnstonLensing07}.  The cluster results break
degeneracies with other probes such as the cosmic microwave background (WMAP).
With DES we will study Dark Energy properties by extending these measurements
back in time.  \label{fig:omegasigma8}} \end{figure}



From galaxy and cluster lensing measurements we confirmed that there is an
enormous amount of unseen dark matter in galaxies, and that this dark matter is
in a ``dark halo'' that extends far beyond the concentrated bundle of stars at
the center of galaxies.  These measurements are completely consistent with the
cold dark matter model.  A number of derived results have come from these basic
measurements papers, in which we have learned a great deal about the connection
between the dark and visible matter in galaxies and clusters, e.g.
\cite{RykoffLXM08,RozoScatter09,TinkerM2N2011}. 

We have also used these measurements to estimate cosmological parameters.  As
stated in the introduction, the number density of halos of a given mass is
related to the mean mass density of the universe and variance in the density.
In \cite{RozoCosmo09} we combined the counts of galaxy clusters with our
lensing mass estimates to constrain these cosmological parameters.  Figure
\ref{fig:omegasigma8} shows results from \cite{RozoCosmo09} constraining the
fractional mass density $\Omega_m$ and the relative variance in mass density on
8 Mpc scales $\sigma_8$.  In \cite{TinkerM2N2011} we use the ratio of mass to
number density in clusters, combined with the large scale cluster of all
galaxies, to place further complimentary constraints on $\Omega_m$ and
$\sigma_8$.  All these results are consistent with one another and the Cold
Dark Matter theory.

While powerful in themselves, these results are also very complimentary to
other measurements, breaking degeneracies in analyses of the Cosmic Microwave
Background \cite{KomatsuWMAPCosmo09}. 

As I will describe in the next section on DES, gravitational shear measurements
are central to two of that survey's primary goals.  The techniques we developed
in the SDSS are directly applicable to DES science, especially the study of
galaxy clusters as cosmological probes.  By extending the measurements backward
in time with the deeper DES data, we will learn about Dark Energy as well as
the Dark Matter.


\begin{comment}
The lensing statistic I use is the gravitational shear.  Because the path of
light in the absence of lensing is not known, the bending angle is not usually
measurable.  But the difference in the bending angle vector across the face of
a source is measurable because it results in a change in the shape of the
background sources.  The unlensed shape is also not known, but because lensing
causes correlations in the shapes of all the galaxies behind a lens that would
not exist without the lensing effect, one can statistically infer the net
change in shape.  This statistical measurement requires averaging the shapes of
a large number of background galaxies.
\end{comment}


\subsection{The Dark Energy Survey (DES)}

The Dark Energy Survey (DES) is an optical, multi-band survey of 5000 square
degrees using the 4-meter ``Blanco'' telescope at the Cerro Tololo
Inter-American Observatory in Chile. A new camera is being built and the
telescope repaired and upgraded.  The DES will utilize gravitational lensing,
an optical cluster survey, supernovae, and galaxy clustering to constrain the
properties of Dark Energy.  Combining DES lensing measurements and DES optical
observations of galaxy clusters with observations by the South Pole Telescope
(SPT, \cite{SPT04}) of the same galaxy clusters, greatly enhances the
constraining power.  These combined methods will constrain the Dark Energy
equation of state parameter $w$ to better than 3\%.  First light is planned for
\commissdate, and the survey will run for five years.  DES operations are
funded in part by the U.S.  Department of Energy. 


The SPT will use the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) Effect, the Compton up-scattering
of light from the cosmic microwave background by the hot gas in galaxy
clusters, to find a complete sample of clusters to high redshift.  This cluster
sample has selection that is complimentary to the DES optical cluster selection
in that it is expected to be nearly independent of the distance of the cluster
from the observer.  As with DES, the goal of the SPT is to use these clusters
to probe the growth of structure, and the volume of space, as a function of
time in order to constrain Dark Energy.  Since it is the number density of
clusters of a given mass that is sensitive to Dark Energy, an important part of
each cluster survey will be the calibration of the mass-observable relationship
via lensing.  In \S \ref{sec:deslensing} I will describe in detail our plans
for measuring this relationship using DES optical data.

In addition to galaxy clusters, the DES will use a number of other probes to
constrain Dark Energy properties.  These include two other lensing probes:
Shear-shear correlations as a function of scale and the cross-correlation
between shear and known objects as a function of scale.  Data are shared
between cluster mass measurements and these probes, but because the correlation
functions cover a much larger range of scales, they are complimentary.  There
is also a Supernova program that, while less constraining by itself, breaks
degeneracies between certain cosmological parameters.  

Table \ref{table:constraints} shows forcasted constraints on $w$ for various
techniques employed by DES \cite{DESWhitePaper}.  These forecasts are for DES
and SPT data alone; combining with other data, for example from cosmic
microwave background measurements from the Planck satellite
\cite{PlanckBluebook}, can significantly increase the precision of certain
probes.

\subsection{Lensing Analysis of DES Data} \label{sec:deslensing}

\subsubsection{Science Analysis}

In collaboration with Mike Jarvis and Bhuvnesh Jain of Penn, I am working to
create data processing pipelines and analysis codes to measure gravitational
lensing in DES.  I will use this data to calibrate the masses of the galaxy
clusters used in the cosmological analyses.  I will also participate in the
measurement of shear-shear correlations (cosmic shear).  These are critical
components of the DES mission.

As described in the introduction, the cosmological information from clusters is
primarily in the number density of clusters with a given mass as a function of
time.  Clusters are identified not by their mass but by other indicators, such
as the SZ effect from SPT data or by the clustering of visible galaxies in DES
imaging data.  The strength of the SZ effect and the number of galaxies are
both correlated with mass, but that correlation must be measured by a secondary
method.  As described in the introduction, lensing is the best method for doing
this.  

As described in \S\ref{sec:sdssold}, in our studies of SDSS lensing we have
developed analysis techniques to calibrate the mass-observable relation of
clusters (Figure \ref{fig:massngals}).  Using this calibration in conjunction
with the number density we have inferred cosmological parameters (Figure
\ref{fig:omegasigma8}).  These techniques are limited only by our understanding
of the systematics and characterization of the cluster selection process.  The
volume and depth of DES is sufficiently large to perform equivalent
measurements in many bins of cosmic time.  Time dependent measurements will
allow us to extend our cosmological analysis to constrain the properties of
Dark Energy.

In contrast with cluster lensing measurements, cosmic shear is the correlation
of shears across the sky independent of the location of foreground structures.
Since the shear is related to mass, the cosmic shear can be used to directly
infer statistics of the underlying mass distribution, the evolution of which is
directly related to the properties of Dark Energy.  Because the signal need not
be modeled in terms of cluster halos, the interpretation of cosmic shear can be
simpler than cluster lensing.  However, the measurement involves directly
correlating shears from many sources as a function of their separation on the
sky, which can propagate systematic errors directly into the measurement. Thus
cosmic shear and cluster lensing are quite complimentary.



Table \ref{table:constraints} shows the power of lensing in the DES to
constrain $w$ as compared to other DES probes.

%\lhead{}
\subsubsection{Data Reduction and Removal of Systematic Effects} 
\label{sec:des:process}

Gravitational Shear alters the shapes of galaxy images, producing recognizable
patterns in their ellipticities across the sky. Thus accurate shear
measurements require accurate measurements of galaxy shapes.  But there are a
number of factors other than lensing that must be taken into account in order
to extract shear signal from the shapes of galaxies. In fact these other
factors are typically 10 to 100 times larger than the shear for a single
galaxy.

The most dominant source of error is the intrinsic shape of the galaxy itself.
While the shear may alter the ellipticity of a galaxy by less than a percent
(the smallest shears measured in \cite{SheldonLensing07} are $10^{-4}$!) the
typical galaxy ellipticity is about 0.3.  It is impossible to measure typical
shears from a single galaxy image.  However, this ``shape noise'' is purely
random, so with enough galaxies the shear signal can be extracted using
statistical techniques.

Other effects are less benign and must be explicitly accounted for in the
measurements.  The most serious of these is the point spread function (PSF) of
the sky plus telescope optical system. The sky causes enough blurring of images
to significantly alter the shapes of most galaxies, diluting the shear signal.
Furthermore the optical system and instrument will significantly distort and
blur the shapes of objects, producing correlations in their shapes that can
mimic lensing.

There are existing techniques for removing these effects but for DES Mike
Jarvis and I are developing a new pipeline designed to be nearly optimal in
tracking the PSF and accounting for its effects in the shear estimation
\cite{Bern02,JarvisJain04}.  Furthermore, this pipeline can make full use of
the multi-epoch DES data where the sky is observed many times.  A prototype of
this ``multishear'' pipeline is already in place and is being tested on
simulated DES data.  For the next year and a half this pipeline will undergo
heavy testing and refinement in preparation for commissioning.  We will further
test this pipeline in a real world setting using the multi-epoch southern SDSS
survey as described in section \S \ref{sec:sdssnew}.  After the survey comes
online in \commissdate, we will process the data in real time as it arrives.  The
processing of simulated and real data will require significant manpower and
computing resources.

\subsection{New Analysis of SDSS Multi-epoch Data} \label{sec:sdssnew}

Once the pipeline described in \S \ref{sec:des:process} reaches a state of
maturity based on testing simulated data, we will process the multi-epoch data
from the SDSS ``southern stripe''.  Although this data is only 225 square
degrees and somewhat shallower than the final DES data, it is interesting both
for testing our pipeline and performing a cosmological analysis.  The data will
be a more stringent test of the pipeline than DES in the sense that there are
many more epochs, typically 30-40.  This means many of the galaxies we use will
have no detection at all on the single epoch images, requiring the multishear
code to deal properly with very noisy data.  But it is an excellent data set
for a lensing analysis as well, being comparable or larger in volume than any
existing cosmic shear study.  I expect at least one publication on cosmological
parameters will be based on this work.

\subsection{BOSS and LSST}

I am a ``architect'' of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS,
\cite{BossWhitePaper}), leading the spectroscopic target selection.  I am also
a member of LSST, working on the early stages of lensing pipeline development.
Although no equipment purchases or additional manpower are required to support
this work, I am contributing a total of 25\% of my time to these two projects.

\subsection{Requested Resources}

The DES survey commissioning will begin in \commissdate\ and run for five years,
generating about a petabyte of data in total.  For lensing we will process all
the reduced single-epoch images and multi-epoch images, which amount to about
130 terabytes.  We must assemble more storage in preparation for the survey
data.

In order to process the data as it arrives we will also require significant
manpower and computing resources.  The NSF funded DES data management (DESDM)
is committed to produce a single processing of the data per year.  Thus,
although our lensing pipelines will be incorporated into DESDM, all development
and testing must occur outside of DESDM.  

In order to test our pipelines and analysis codes we must process the full data
set many times.  This is because many systematics tests require essentially
the full data set to explore.  And only from analyzing the full data set to
extract the lensing signal will we be able to feed back what we have learned
into the pipelines.  Working with a single processing would be highly
restrictive.  Thus we must have our own separate computing resources to
facilitate these tests and analyses.  

We projected our current running times, and expect it would take about 2.5
weeks to process the final DES data on a moderate 70 node cluster with at least
8 cores per node and 4 GB of memory per core.  These  numbers assume 2015
computer speeds, which will be the ``average'' speed for our computers
purchased over the five year period. This is approximately the desired
processing time given that we want to reprocess the data with several
iterations on two or more independent shape algorithms in order to obtain a
robust result.

We will also require significant resources for the science analysis, which is
computationally intensive.  As a reference point, the SDSS analysis presented
in \S \ref{sec:sdssold} required running for a week on a cluster of 80
processors.  The mass and luminosity analysis of \cite{SheldonM2L07} is even
more intensive, requiring two weeks on a 300 processor cluster (although these
computers were a factor of two slower than the current generation).  The DES
data set will be 50 times larger.

Because of Moore's law, it makes sense to buy the computing over a period of
time.  To store and process the DES images, we propose to spend about
\$31,000/year for five years (2012-2016), accruing about 130TB of storage per
year plus processing nodes.  The first year we will acquire around 14TB of
storage and 20 nodes with at least 4GB of memory per core and at least 8 cores.
Or reference spec is  26kSI2k, 104 HEP-SPEC 2006 .  In following years we will
purchase more disk and CPU for the same price, and keep a trajectory to our
goal.  We expect to assemble a system with about 70 actual nodes, which is
about 120 units of our spec.  An outline of our plans for computing
purchases is shown in Table \ref{table:computing}.

Note these prices include bulk discounts from purchasing along with other
experiments through the RHIC Computing Facility at BNL.

We also ask for 100\%  of Erin Sheldon's salary and overhead for five years ,
and 100\% for a research associate for five years.  

The remaining funds are primarily for travel expenses.   The DES collaboration
is multi-national and Erin Sheldon and a postdoc will most likely travel abroad
to the collaboration meetings.  Sheldon plans to spend three weeks each summer
at a workshop in the US, such as those held at Aspen and Santa Fe.  Further
travel will involve attending a few conferences per year across the US for both
Sheldon and Ma.  Erin Sheldon will also make regular trips to the University of
Pennsylvania to collaborate with Mike Jarvis and Bhuvnesh Jain.

\section*{Appendix 4: Facilities and Other Resources}

We plan to acquire a large amount of computing.  The housing, power and
cooling, andministration, and maintenence for these computers will be provided
by the RHIC Computing Facility at Brookhaven National Lab at no additional cost
to this proposal.

\section*{Appendix 5: Equipment}

The equipment currently available to this project is a set of fourteen
computers purchased in 2009 and 2010, consisting of one file server and
thirteen compute nodes.  The file server holds 40 Terabytes and each compute
node is dual quad core with 32 Gigabytes of ram.  These are housed at the RHIC
Computing Facility at BNL.
