I propose to analyze data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) to constrain the
properties of Dark Energy.  My primary focus will be on measuring gravitational
lensing effects to probe the expansion history and growth rate of massive
structures in our universe.  

Dark Energy accelerates the expansion of the universe, dramatically increasing
the volume in comparison to a matter-only universe.  Dark Energy also inhibits
the growth of massive structures under gravitational collapse.  Thus the number
density of massive objects such as galaxy clusters as a function of cosmic time
is directly related to the properties of Dark Energy, in particular the
equation of state parameter w=pressure/density.  Critical to using the number
density to constrain cosmology is the masses of the clusters, which we will
measure using gravitational lensing effects in DES data.  Using cluster counts,
lensing and other complimentary probes, the DES will measure w to about 3%.

DES will see first light in 2012.  I will spend the intervening time developing
data reduction pipelines and realistic simulations to test these pipelines.
After first light, DES will take data for five years, during which I will
process the data as it arrives and perform analysis to extract Dark Energy
parameters.
