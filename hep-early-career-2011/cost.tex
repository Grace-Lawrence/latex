    \tablecomments{The number of compute nodes purchased is based on
    the assumption that each node (26kSI2k, 104 HEP-SPEC 2006) would stay at the
    performance level of a node purchased in 2010. As the performance per node will
    increase over time the actual number of compute nodes after 3 years will be
    significantly smaller (probably O(70)), providing a combined performance of
    O(120) 2010 equivalent nodes. Prices include 40\% bulk discounts from
    purchasing through the RHIC ATLAS Computing Facility at BNL. {\bf Power,
    cooling and maintence will be provided at no extra cost.} Although we list
    storage purchases per year, storage most likely be bought in two or
    three larger chunks.  }
