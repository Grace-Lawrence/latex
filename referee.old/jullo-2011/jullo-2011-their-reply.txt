******Author Reply******

Dear referee,

First of all, thank you very much for your numerous and detailed comments. We
have tried to address them as well as possible, and we hope you'll find that
the manuscript has improved.  

Following your advice, we reworked our data analysis. In particular, we now fit
a set of models to our measurements - and derive some physical quantities, such
as the halo mass and scale at which bias starts to decrease. We also fit the
bias slope at small scales, but do not measure any significant evolution with
redshift.

We have rewritten large portions of the text, either to reflect this new
analysis, or to improve the quality of the English.  

You'll also find an attached figure that compares the galaxy redshift
distribution (in a foreground and a background bin) obtained from a histogram
of the best fit photozs, with the sum of full posterior probabilities output by
the photo-z code. This figure comes along with an answer to one of your
comments below.

Please find below the detailed answers to your comments.


Best regards

sigma_i is the (per component) standard deviation of galaxies' intrinsic
ellipticities. This is indeed a component of the error, and the denominator in
equation (1) is approximately the total error. To avoid confusion, we don't
really want to say the word error - it's not exactly right - so we have just
reworded the phrase more precisely as "the standard deviation of the galaxy
ellipticity distribution".

We rearranged this subsection. We split it into 2 subsections as suggested:
2.3.1 for the binning in redshift, and 2.3.2 for the stellar-mass and flux
selection.

Indeed, we do not know the actual redshift distribution of the material, so we
can only compute the effective weight. We now discuss this distinction in
section 2.3.1 ("We must emphasize that the redshift distribution we
obtain...").

We applied the same straight cuts to the foreground sample that we used for the
background sample. We have now clarified this in section 2.3.1 ("Foreground
galaxies are assigned to their respective bins...").

Sorry - we just meant the peak of the lensing efficiency in redshift space. We
have now spelled this out in section 2.3.1 ("we discuss how a mismatch between
the center of the redshift bins...")

We are not explicitly talking about bias in the photozs at this point in the
paper. Indeed, our technique of summing photo-z likelihoods helps to minimize
errors that would have been introduced if we had only considered the best fit
photo-zs. Such errors can be especially important as the likelihoods typically
do not have a Gaussian shape. We return to this discussion later in this reply.

Our catalog is complete up to I814 = 26.5. We found the S/N of galaxy
photometry at I814=26.5 to be 5.5+-1.1. We also measured the photozs accuracy
dz / 1 + z for our foreground redshift bins. We found the photozs error for bin
F1 to be the largest with dz / 1 +z = 0.03. This good accuracy of the photozs
is largely due to the extra cuts we apply (K < 24, ZP2=-99, MU_CLASS==1).
Without those extra cuts, we obtain dz/1+z = 0.24 for bin F1. In our study, we
also apply those same cuts to the background catalogs, and consequently we
think that the overlap between lens and source samples must be limited. Note
that to measure stellar-mass, galaxies must be brighter. In our catalogs, we
have found that stellar-mass selected galaxies have I814 < 22.5.

The paragraph has been simplified, and the equations left as suggested.

We have spelled out what we meant - that aperture statistics are powerful
because all the power spectra are filtered by the same narrow band filter,
whereas the correlation functions xsi+, xsi-, w(theta), and <gamma_t> involve
different filters. Combining them directly would lead to a mixing of modes in
Fourier space, and would hamper the interpretation

We have rewritten this section, and split it into two parts (3.2 and 3.3).
Section 3.2 now exclusively explain how we calculated f1 and f2.

It is the average of the bias measured on all scales R > 2 h^{-1}Mpc, where R
is defined in the new equations (24) and (25). We have now spelled this out in
the caption of Figure 13.

Our two options for constructing a redshift distribution were to stack the full
photo-z likelihoods or just the best-fit photo-zs. We enclose a the results of
a toy model showing how much better the likelihoods are than the best-fit
values, for both foreground and background bins. The figure compares a
histogram of true redshifts from a mock realization of galaxies, with a
histogram of the best-fit photo-zs and the sum of their photo-z likelihoods
(the overall normalizations are only approximately matched). To simulate
photo-zs, we added noise to their redshifts, drawn from a Gaussian
distribution; to simulate the likelihoods, we assigned that same Gaussian. We
then binned the galaxies or summed the likelihoods in the same way we did with
the real data (ie z_low < z^i +/- \sigma^i < z_high). The sum of likelihoods is
by far the best match of the true redshift distribution, and this most
accurately reproduces the true lensing sensitivity.  

In our analysis, we therefore chose the sum of likelihoods approach. We also
now investigate what happens if we shift the background bin (section 6.2,
figure 18). With the available real data, there are no other options for the
foreground bins, and we can do no better. The propagation of subtle photo-z
errors into lensing sensitivities depends on the exact nature of those photo-z
errors (hence the SEDs of the galaxies and the models), so investigating that
is beyond the scope of this single paper. However, we have tried to be clear
and explicit about these caveats throughout.

We replaced the x labels of these figures with 'Radial bin'.

We have recalculated the statistics using means instead of medians, to match
theoretical predictions as suggested. The resulting parameter b (Figure 12) has
changed by less than 3%. We initially preferred the median because of the
Cauchy distribution of the bootstrapped samples of the bias parameter b^2 =
\nap2 / \map2. However, for the other estimators \omega, \xip, \xim, \gamma_t,
\nap2, \map2 and \nmap, the bootstrapped samples have a Gaussian distribution,
so mean or median makes negligible difference.

Done.

We now explain this in section 5.1 ("The deviation between the predicted signal
is computed with a Smith et al. PS and **unbiased galaxies**." and "We observe
significant deviations between the measured signal and...").

We rephrased the last sentence of the paragraph to make it clear that we are
talking about systematic errors.

We made this claim in light of the other measurements (\nap2, \map2 and \nmap),
where we can see more signal than predicted at small scale. But you are right,
this interpretation is beyond what we can say given the error bars, and we
removed this sentence.

This paragraph was confusing so we removed it.

Mandelbaum 2006 also performed the 45deg test. They found deviation from zero
at 68% confidence level, but no deviation at 95% confidence level. We performed
a $chi^2$ test, and found no deviation at 95% confidence level. Does that fully
answers your comment?

By "cleaner", we meant that the correlation between different scales is smaller
for aperture statistics than for the correlation functions (see Schneider et
al. 2002, Fig 3). However, this sentence was misplaced in the middle of the
discussion about the shape of the signal, so we removed it.

We followed your suggestion, and replaced "clear" by "see by eye". We have also
added a quantitative statistical analysis in section 5.3.

We have performed a new statistical analysis of our data. We found that the
predicted signal is consistent with the data points at 68% confidence level. We
also found that the deviation of the data points from the predicted signal in
B1 is not significant. We therefore removed the corresponding sentence from
this paragraph.

We also removed the discussion about intrinsic alignment, which is now
redundant since the discrepancy between the predicted and the measured signal
is not significant.

We have entirely rewritten section 5.3. We have performed a statistical
analysis of the data, and interpreted the data in light of this.

Indeed, we used the full covariance matrix in the fit. We have rewritten the
paragraph to make it more explicit.

We completely reorganized this section. We added quantitative statistics and
estimated the halo mass of the galaxies in our mass-selected samples.

We have also now fitted the bias model proposed by Tinker et al. 2010.

We rephrased the paragraph, and now state that the deviation is not
significant. However, we kept some of the discussion as an illustration of how
bias is computed, and also because we found it puzzling that no large groups or
clusters are found at this redshift, but the galaxy bias is so large.

Done.

We computed a chi2-test between our measurements and a constant r=1, and found
that the dip is not significant. We updated the text accordingly.

Neyrinck et al. say "The profile of galaxy halos of different masses are more
similar to each other at small scales than at intermediate scales." (5.2.1
paragraph 6). We replaced our confusing sentence and cited Neyrinck's verbatim.
We also rearranged the rest of the paragraph for clarity.

This issue has been investigated in Kilbinger et al. 2006. In theory to compute
<Map2>, the \xi_p and \xi_m correlation functions must be integrated from zero
to infinity, whereas in practice we integrate from a non zero lower limit, and
over noisy quantities. We now cite this paper ("Kilbinger et al. 2006 found
that the signal is underestimated ...")

We have removed that sentence because we have now performed a quantitative
analysis of the data, and could now state the significance of the
redshift-dependence of bias instead.

We were trying to understand why <NM> decreases at large scales, and
hypothesized that it could be due to the repeat use of source galaxies. We
looked into this issue further and agree with you. We have found other possible
explanations in the literature, and have decided to replace our hypothesis with
those we found. ("Mandelbaum et al. 2005 identify this as an edge effect...")

We reformulated the section. Our conclusion for this section is that it is
important to match the mean redshift of the foreground galaxies, with the peak
of the lensing efficiencies because of cosmic variance. Indeed, the true power
spectrum might not grow linearly at the scale we are looking at, and the
lensing efficiency might not represent the true p(z) of the matter. This is
especially true for a limited size survey such as COSMOS, and at small scales.

We have updated this paragraph, recalling our quantitative results with the
model fitting.

This number just comes from the result in Hoekstra et al. 2002 and Simon et al.
2007. They both had wide field survey, and Hoekstra et al. with 50deg2 already
had a detection of the scale-dependence of bias at 8 sigma.  

We rewrote this paragraph following another approach based on signal to noise.
We now base our estimate for a future field size on the fact that errors in our
measurements are mostly due to shape noise. Since the errors on mass aperture
are proportional to the number of galaxies, we can roughly say that a field 10
times larger will produce errors almost 10 times smaller for b=1 and r=1.
