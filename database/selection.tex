\subsection{Selection of Entries}

The database contains all entries within the primary row range for each
field. Recall that the fields in the SDSS runs are defined artificially, since
in fact each camcol of each run is one long image. When breaking up into
fields, some overlap is kept between the two fields in order to minimize the
effect of this arbitrary edge.  This overlap is 64 rows on either side of the
field.

This cut is equivalent to demanding the STATUS flag \texttt{OK\_RUN} is
set. The only exceptions are the first and last field: since there is actually
no overlap, there is no need to cut the first 64 rows for the first field and
the last 64 for the last field.  Thus the actual cut is this:

\begin{equation}
\textrm{row} > (field > fieldmin)*64~~\&\&~~\textrm{row} < \left[1489 - (field < fieldmax)*64 \right]
\end{equation}
