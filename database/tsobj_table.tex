\section{tsObj Table}

This table contains info from the tsObj files 
\footnote{http://www-sdss.fnal.gov:8000/edoc/dm/flatFiles/tsObj.html}. All
columns were kept other than the matching information (e.g. ROSAT, USNO) and
the profile columns \texttt{PROFMEAN} and \texttt{PROFERR}.  The number of
matches is relatively small, and it makes more sense to use the skyserver for
this sort of analysis.  The profile info is rarely used (by me anyway) and
takes up a lot of space (15X5 array). The columns which exist for each of the
five SDSS bandpasses are broken up into separate columns (MySQL does not
support arrays) with the bandpass appended, e.g. \texttt{PETROCOUNTS\_G}.  When
read from IDL, these can be read as a set of 5, e.g. \texttt{PETROCOUNTS[5]}.
This formatting is supported by the general reader \texttt{mysql\_query.pro}
when /sdss is set, and also by \texttt{sdss\_mysql\_readbyid.pro}.
