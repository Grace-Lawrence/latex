%A list, in reverse chronological order, of all the individualÕs academic/professional appointments beginning
%with the current appointment.
%If the proposer has a website address readily available, that information should be included in the citation, as stated
%above. It is not NSF's intent, however, to place an undue burden on proposers to search for the URL of every
%referenced publication. Therefore, inclusion of a website address is optional. A proposal that includes reference
%citation(s) that do not specify a URL address is not considered to be in violation of NSF proposal preparation
%guidelines and the proposal will still be reviewed.
