\opening{To Whom It May Concern:}

I acknowledge that I am identified by name as Collaborator to the investigation
entitled ``Galaxies in Clusters: A New Dark Energy Probe" that is being
submitted by PI Risa Wechsler and Co-PI Jeremy Tinker to the National Science
Foundation, and that I intend to carry out all responsibilities identified for
me in this proposal. This will include measuring the projected shear around
galaxy clusters in simulations and SDSS and DES data.  I understand that the
extent and justification of my participation as stated in this proposal will be
considered during peer review in determining in part the merits of this
proposal.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
