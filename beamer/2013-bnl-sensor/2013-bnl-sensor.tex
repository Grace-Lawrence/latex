            \begin{itemize}
                \item The path of light appears curved as it passes massive objects
                \item The ``deflection'' can differ across the face of an extended source galaxy, causing distortion.
                \item Shear distorts the image; we say it's ``shape'' is altered.
                \item Shearing produces correlations in the shapes of galaxies across the sky.
                    Shape correlations are closely related to mass density
                    correlations.

    \frametitle{Measuring Shear}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item For a perfect detector with no noise, just measure
            the second moments and look for the correlations.
        \item The atmosphere, telescope, and instrument smear
            the image: the Point Spread Function (PSF).
        \item That just adds to the moments, so we just need to
            subtract off the PSF moments!
        \item .... but there is noise, so the moments don't converge (among
            other difficulties).
    \end{itemize}
}

\frame
{
    \frametitle{PSF and Noise}
    
    \begin{itemize}

        \item One can use a weight function to suppress the noise, but then one
            must derive how that measurement responds to smearing by the PSF
            and shearing (e.g. Kaiser, Squires, \& Broadhurst, Bernstein \& Jarvis, Melchior,
                    Bernstein \& Armstrong).  Working in Fourier space can help
            with the deconvolution (Bernstein).

        \item Alternatively, one can forward-model the problem: fit a model that is
            convolved with an estimate of the PSF.  Limited by how well one can
            model the galaxy and PSF (e.g. Miller et al., Bernstein \& Armstrong, many
            others).

        \item These methods can be made to work pretty well, as long as
            the $S/N$ is still pretty high, say 50 or higher.

    \end{itemize}
}

\frame
{
    \frametitle{Noise}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item When the $S/N$ is low, these techniques break down.
        \item Non-linear fitting in the presence of noise is biased, both
            the maximum likelihood and expectation value: using the mean
            shape won't work (Hirata, Refregier, etc).  This is well 
            known in statistics. 
        \item The noise also causes problems for moment based methods.
    \end{itemize}
}

\frame
{
    \frametitle{Alternate Methods}

    \begin{itemize}

        \item Miller et al. 2007 (lensfit): Use prior on the shape distribution
            and explore full posterior surface. Derive how the shear estimate
            (the shape) is affected by the noise and prior using integrals over
            the likelihood surface and first order approximation in shear.

        \item A difficulty with lensfit is that likelihood of the shape for a
            single galaxy is complex and depends on galaxy properties and
            noise, no generic formulation can be made for the response.

    \end{itemize}
}

\frame
{
    \frametitle{Alternate Methods}

    \begin{itemize}

        \item Could increase the $S/N$ by stacking around peaks in image
            assuming the shear is constant over a small patch.  Model the full
            two-point correlation function of the light, which is sheared just
            as galaxy images are.  Don't need to de-blend.  Not fully explored.
            (ES)
    \end{itemize}
}
\frame
{
    \frametitle{Bernstein \& Armstrong 2013}

    \begin{itemize}

        \item While the likelihood surface for the {\it shape} of
            single galaxy is complex, the posterior surface for the
            {\it mean shear} of an {\bf ensemble} should approach a
            Gaussian.  This must be true from the central limit
            theorem.

         \item With the Gaussian assumption, and assumption of weak
             shear, can derive an unbiased estimator for the shear.

         \item You lose nothing: in the limit of weak shear, you need
             to use an ensemble statistic anyway.  The ``shape noise'',
             intrinsic variance in shapes of galaxies, dominates over
             the signal. XXX introduce shape noise earlier.
