- Outline
    - explain that I want to give significant time to introducing lensing, as
      it may be unfamiliar to many

- Lensing
    - Newton quote from Opticks Query 1

    - Discussion of equivalence principle and GR
        - Einstein 1911
            - bodies in free fall behave as in an inertial frame
            - example:  friends shining flashlights?
        - GR
            - interpret as curved space-time
            - geodesics

    - Examples
    - 1919 eclipse
    - quasar 0957
    - clusters of galaxies
    - details of

    - show the geometry
    - show cartoon of the total effect
        - discuss symmetry properties

    - Weak lensing
        - statistical
        - enables us to use this probe in any situation, not just special,
          fortuitous alignments
    - * symmetries here?

- Dark Matter

    - Zwicky 1937
        - show coma
        - this method has been used recently as well, with known limitations
        - show quote about lensing

    - Rotation curves of galaxies
        - show galaxy
        - show curve
        - mass appears to grow out to the edge, what about beyond that?

    - Cold Dark Matter (CDM)
        - some form of matter that does not significantly emit or absorb light
        - best candidate is an elementary particle, weakly interacting
        - so far explains all we see, as I will discuss below

    - Early Successes of CDM
        - explains rotation curves of galaxies
        - explains the dynamics of galaxy clusters
        - explains the large scale distribution of galaxies: without it we
          would predict a wildly different universe
        - essential component needed to explain the cosmic microwave
          background

    - predictions of CDM

        - "universal" radial profile of gravitationally bound dark matter
          structures, "halos"

          - show picture
          - say from first principles can prediction ~power law nature, but
            details are interesting (broken power law)

        - dark matter distributed smoothly throughout the universe, as
          compared to dissipative baryonic material, which loses energy and
          collapses into relatively compact structures.

            - correlations in this field known from first principles on the
              largest scales

        - needed a way to test these predictions

- Measurement Methods

    - Difficulties/limitations of dynamical methods
        - visible tracers are required
        - cannot trace out the orbits, the timescales are too long
            - assumptions must be made about the dynamical state of the system
            - limits the scale over which it this can be used

    - lensing has none of these limitations
        - The weak effect can be observed anywhere
        - The distribution of matter can be studied on a large range of scales
            - galaxies, galaxy clusters, bound objects
            - structure on the largest scales in the universe

    - It does have some limitations
        - it is a weak effect in general (other than special cases)
        - statistical approach is required

        - But these are unimportant limitations. The theory doesn't predict
          anything about individual objects anyway: these are messy systems
          with a complicated history

- Dark Matter distribution in and around Galaxies

    - SDSS project

    - Galaxy-galaxy lensing
        - source and lens are both galaxies
        - many sources found behind each lens: average in radial bins
        - Average the signal from many lenses
             - remember the prediction is for the average, no loss here
        - Explore signal as a function of observed properties

    - interpretation as a function of scale

    - Show SDSS results all galaxies

    - As a function of luminosity
        - Fixed dark matter/light ratio?
