- Outline
    - explain that I want to give significant time to introducing lensing, as
      it may be unfamiliar to many

- Lensing
    - Newton quote from Opticks Query 1

    - Discussion of equivalence principle and GR
        - Einstein 1911
        - GR factor of 2

    - Examples
    - 1919 eclipse
    - quasar 0957
    - clusters of galaxies
    - details of

    - show the geometry
    - show cartoon of the total effect

    - Weak lensing
        - statistical
        - enables us to use this probe in any situation, not just special,
          fortuitous alignments
    - * symmetries here?

- Dark Matter

    - Zwicky 1937
        - show coma
        - show quote about lensing
    - Rotation curves of galaxies
        - show galaxy
        - show curve
    - Difficulties/limitations of these methods
        - visible tracers are required
        - cannot trace out the orbits, the timescales are too long
            - assumptions must be made about the dynamical state of the system
            - limits the scale over which it this can be used

    - lensing has none of these limitations
        - The weak effect can be observed anywhere
        - The distribution of matter can be studied on a large range of scales
            - galaxies, galaxy clusters, bound objects
            - structure on the largest scales in the universe
    - It does have some limitations
        - it is a weak effect in general (other than special cases)
        - statistical approach is required
        - unimportant, because the theory doesn't predict individual objects
          anyway
