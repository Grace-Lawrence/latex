    \frametitle{Cosmology with Lensing}

    \begin{itemize}

        \item Lensing depends on mass and geometry.

        \item If we know where everything is (lens and source) we can use
            lensing to measure mass.

            \begin{itemize}

                \item This is especially useful for measuring the
                    distribution of dark matter in the universe
                \item The connection between galaxies and dark matter.

            \end{itemize}

        \item If we know the mass, or control for it, we can measure geometry.
            
            \begin{itemize}

                \item This is especially interesting for measuring dark energy,
                    which is driving the expansion. 
                \item If we know the redshifts to
                    everything and the absolute distance between everything
                    from lensing, we infer the redshift-distance relation
                    and thus cosmological parameters, including dark energy.

        \item Clusters are messy and they have neighbors and projected
            structures along the line of sight.

        \item Averaging them together makes the interpretation much simpler.

        \item There is a whopping signal even in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

    \begin{itemize}

        \item There is tons of $S/N$ even in SDSS, with the Dark Energy Survey
            (DES) the signal will increase because the lenses are at higher
            redshift.

        \item In DES the images are deeper, facilitating using about 10 times more
            galaxies for shear measurement.
         
        \item How do we know we got the right answer?

    \end{itemize}
}

\frame{
    \frametitle{Did We Get the Right Answer?}

    \begin{itemize}

        \item We might have used the wrong distances.  We don't have redshifts for 
            the sources, only 5-filter photometry.  Major current and future surveys
            all have the same limitation.

        \item We might have measured the wrong shear.  There are a lot of ways to
            get this wrong: atmosphere, instrument, noise, etc.

\frame{
    \frametitle{Photometric Redshifts}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Infer the redshift based on broad band photometry.

        \item Difficult because there are strong degeneracies: e.g. luminous
            blue objects at high redshift look like faint red objects at low
            redshift.

        \item Naive techniques have lots of scatter, significant bias, especially
            as galaxy spectral features move between filters, and a large outlier
            population.

        \item Good progress in recent years with a huge variety of techniques.

    \end{itemize}
}

\frame{
    \frametitle{Ensemble Photometric Redshifts}
    
    \begin{itemize}

        \item Forget about estimating {\em the redshift} of a single galaxy
            from the light measured through a few broadband filters. It can't
            be done without strong prior information.

        \item Just try to estimate the overall redshift distribution $N(z)$.

        \item For much lensing work $N(z)$ is sufficient.
        
        \item Secondarily try to learn something about the probability distribution
            as a function of redshift for each galaxy $P(z)$.  Useful as a weight
            for studies such as ensemble cluster lensing.

    \end{itemize}
}

\frame{
    \frametitle{Ensemble Photometric Redshifts}
    
    \begin{itemize}

        \item An ensemble set of well measured quantities that correlate with
            redshift is an indicator of the ensemble distribution of redshifts.

         \item Assumption: If the distribution of all relevant observables are
             the same for two populations then so are the redshift distributions
             $N(z)$.

         \item Can break down if the two samples have very different selection
             in a redshift-correlated variable that is not included, but it
             turns out this is not a problem in practice (Cunha et al. 2012).
             The real problem is wrong redshifts in the training set.

                \item A mockup of the SDSS samples shows the weighting

                range of interest $\left[0.0, 0.3\right]$

        \item Non-linear fitting in the presence of noise is biased, both the
            maximum likelihood and expectation value: using the mean shape
            won't work (Hirata, Refregier, etc).   Results in a {\bf

        \item This is generally known in statistics, but not recognized for our

        \item Bernstein \& Armstrong 2014

        \item Forget about estimating a weak shear from a single galaxy
            image. It can't be done.  Galaxies are elliptical and this
            noise dominates, so you have to average anyway.

        \item But we know true things that can help: the posterior
            distribution of the mean shear averaged from many galaxies must
            approach a Gaussian: central limit theorem.
        
        \item We also know the shear is weak.

        \item Assuming Gaussianity, weak shear, and knowledge of underlying
             distribution of shapes for the ensemble (the prior), one can
             derive an unbiased estimator for the mean shear of the ensemble.

            convolved with an estimate of the PSF.  Limited by how well one can
            model the galaxy and PSF (e.g. Miller et al., Bernstein \& Armstrong, many
            others).

        \item The posterior surface of the shape for a single galaxy is
            complex.  The space is bounded, the surface is necessarily
            asymmetric and depends on galaxy properties and noise.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item I did my own tests of LENSFIT with strong structural priors (30\% lognormal
            on flux, 15\% on size (that was a bug...) ).

        \item Very fast code using gaussian mixtures to approximate galaxies.  Fast
            analytic convolutions.

        \item Bias vs \snT\ has more universal form than vs \snflux.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}

        \item Shape is not shear.
        \item While the posterior surface for the {\it shape} of single galaxy
            is complex, the posterior surface for the {\it mean shear} of an
            ensemble must approach a Gaussian according to the central limit
            theorem.  This is both useful and actually true!

         \item Assuming Gaussianity, weak shear, and knowledge of underlying
             distribution of shapes for the ensemble (the prior), one can
             derive an unbiased estimator for the mean shear of the ensemble.

         \item You lose nothing: in the limit of weak shear, you need
             to use an ensemble statistic anyway.  The ``shape noise'',
             intrinsic variance in shapes of galaxies, dominates over
             the signal.

        \item This is a good idea, but needed an implementation, so I worked it
            into my existing code.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Can push to lower \snT\ than LENSFIT.

        \item Bias varies with \snT\ in a simpler way than LENSFIT.
        \item Bias vs \snT\ even more universal. Sufficient accuracy for DES at \snT$ > 10$.

\frame{
    \frametitle{Limitations}
    \begin{itemize}

        \item I'm assuming I can find the right model.  Not true in real data.
            Should be OK for DES (Kacprzak et al. 2013) but not LSST.

        \item TODO: 
            
            \begin{itemize}

                \item Explore more realistic intrinsic distributions in
                    structural parameters (size, flux).  E.g. for a bin in {\it
                    measured} flux, what are the {\it true} distributions in
                    size and flux?  Use Cosmos.

                \item Why is there bias at all?  Is it the likelhood sampling method?

                \item Bernstein \& Armstrong propose a model-independent
                    technique using moments in Fourier space, but not yet
                    implemented.  Gary and Bob plan to do it.  Student at Stony
                    Brooke as well (Madhavacheril).

\frame{
    \frametitle{Summary}

    \begin{itemize}

        \item Shear estimation is difficult in the presence of noise.

        \item Modern techniques can work well enough for current surveys.

        \item For future experiments such as LSST we need a model-independent
            approach.

    \end{itemize}
